    <p>From time to time I get questions about caching strategies and mobile devices. Definitely when you want to create different responses in the back end based on the device AND you have strong caching strategies, things get very tricky.</p>
<p>An example scenario in Drupal (but can relate to any CMS) is where you boost performance by storing the generated pages as static files (see <b><a href="http://drupal.org/project/boost">Boost</a>).</b></p>
<p>These solutions rely heavily on Apache in a way that Apache delivers the static files in case these files exist. Otherwise it passes the request to the CMS.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-meta">
      <a href="/aggregator/sources/1" class="feed-item-source">Ultimas noticias do drupal</a> -
      <span class="feed-item-date">sab, 10/09/2011 - 15:45</span>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>The Quicktabs module now has a stable release on two Drupal 6 branches (that's right, it never had a stable D6 release until a few weeks ago :-/) and on two D7 branches. The 7.x-3.x branch represents a complete rewrite of the module, providing much greater flexibility in what can be done with it.</p>

<p>Quicktabs 3.0 for Drupal 7 uses ctools for plugin management and provides two types of plugins: renderer and content plugins. The renderer plugins provided with the module are <strong>jQuery UI Tabs</strong>, <strong>jQuery UI Accordion</strong>, and classic Quicktabs, which is essentially the original "homegrown" tabs mechanism, including ajax support*. Content plugins are for providing different "things" that can be output as tab content, e.g. blocks, views, nodes, other Quicktabs instances. One new content plugin that's provided is the menu callback plugin, which allows you to specify any Drupal path and have that displayed as the content of a tab.</p>
<img src="http://katbailey.net/sites/default/files/accordion.png" />
<p>So an obvious way that developers can extend Quicktabs is to write plugins for it, and I've been pleased to hear of some interesting plugins already in the works. However, there is another important way in which Quicktabs is now far more flexible than it ever was before and that's in the way that you can programmatically build a Quicktabs instance. You could do this to a certain extent in previous versions, but the 7.x-3.x branch allows you to shove basically whatever you want into a Quicktabs instance.</p>

<p>A neat example of this is if your page design calls for having the current node's comments as one of a set of tabs (the other tabs might be views of content related to the node or whatever). So you can implement hook_page_alter(), where you'll get the entire page array, grab the comments out of it, and smoosh them into a Quicktabs instance. Like this:</p>
&lt;?php<br />/**<br /> * Implements hook_page_alter().<br /> */<br />function my_module_page_alter(&amp;$data) {<br />&nbsp; if (isset($data['content']['system_main']['nodes'])) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $nids = element_children($data['content']['system_main']['nodes']);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $nid = $nids[0];<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // We'll place the node comments inside a quicktabs block.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $comments = $data['content']['system_main']['nodes'][$nid]['comments'];<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unset($data['content']['system_main']['nodes'][$nid]['comments']);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $overrides = array('ajax' =&gt; 0, 'style' =&gt; 'nostyle'); // Override some of the settings for the QT instance.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $custom_tabs = array(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; array(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'title' =&gt; 'Comments',<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'contents' =&gt; $comments, // Custom tabs must have a contents property.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'weight' =&gt; 0<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; );<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Our 'node_activities' Quicktabs instance has just one tab, we're going to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // add a second tab to it, containing the node comments.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $data['content']['qt_activities'] = array(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'content' =&gt; quicktabs_build_quicktabs('node_activities', $overrides, $custom_tabs),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '#weight' =&gt; 99,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; );<br />&nbsp; }<br />}<br />?&gt;
<p>And the result: </p>
<img src="http://katbailey.net/sites/default/files/hub_ss.png" />
<p>
The documentation for the quicktabs_build_quicktabs() function explains the parameters it takes:
<br />
 * @param name. The machine name of the Quicktabs instance to build - if a name<br />
 *  is passed that does not correspond to an existing instance, then it is taken<br />
 *  to be a completely custom instance and is built from only the custom tabs<br />
 *  that are passed in.<br />
 *<br />
 * @param overrides. Options that will override the options of the Quicktabs<br />
 *  instance from the database, or if no existing instance is being used, these<br />
 *  will override the default options. Possible keys are 'style', 'hide_empty_tabs',<br />
 *  ajax', 'default_tab', 'renderer', 'title'.<br />
 *<br />
 * @param custom_tabs. An array representing custom tab contents, which will be<br />
 *  appended to the Quicktabs instance from the database, or if no existing instance<br />
 *  is being used, the custom tabs will be the entire contents. An example custom_tabs<br />
 *  array would be array(array('title' =&gt; 'custom', 'contents' =&gt; array('#markup' =&gt;<br />
 *  t('Some markup'), 'weight' =&gt; 5));<br />
</p>
 
<p>Essentially, you can take advantage of this function to rearrange parts of a render array into tabbed content or create tabbed content from scratch.</p>


<p>As with the 6.x-3.x version, Quicktabs instances are fully exportable as features components. Go forth and tabbify!</p>



*jQuery UI Tabs provides an ajax option but it's actually quite inflexible and I felt it wasn't what we needed so I spent some time trying to make Tabs work with the new Ajax framework in core, i.e. suppressing its ajax behaviour in favour of the more flexible functionality in core's ajax framework. I came up against a bit of a brick wall in that endeavour - see <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1108978" title="http://drupal.org/node/1108978">http://drupal.org/node/1108978</a>.

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>Most of the JavaScript you see on the web is full of anonymous functions. I don't think most of them are necessary. Allow me to demonstrate.</p>

<p>Imagine a PHP developer—let's call her Sunny—who doesn't really write JavaScript, but needs to toggle some text on a page. Sunny goes searching for examples on Google, and finds this jQuery snippet:</p>

$ = jQuery;

$(document).ready(function () {
  $('a#toggler').click(function () { 
    var $paragraph = $('p#text-to-hide');
    // Show the paragraph if it's hidden.
    if ($paragraph.is(':hidden')) {
      $paragraph.show();
      $(this).text('Click to hide');
    }
    // Hide the paragraph if it's already showing.
    else {
      $paragraph.hide();
      $(this).text('Click to show');
    }
  });
});

<a id="toggler">Click to hide</a>
<p id="text-to-hide">Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet venison ham hock pork loin, labore sunt fatback id. Bresaola short ribs ball tip tail, quis ea ribeye. Andouille velit tail, minim shankle non hamburger consectetur jowl biltong. Short ribs shank pancetta, excepteur corned beef ut eiusmod labore kielbasa.</p>



<p>Sunny doesn't really get what's going on with the nested function () {} business, but the code works fine. So she happily sticks it into a &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;, changes the HTML ids to match her content, and forgets all about it... until the next month, when her boss says, "Hey, remember that great little show/hide feature you wrote? Marketing wants the same thing for every section on the page."</p>

<p>Now Sunny has to figure out how to make that little snippet reusable. "No problem!" she thinks. "I'll just make it into a function that takes a couple of id parameters so it knows what links are toggling which paragraphs." So she gives that a try:</p>


function toggle(link_id, paragraph_id) {
  var $link = $('#' + link_id);
  var $paragraph = $('#' + paragraph_id);
  // Show the paragraph if it's hidden.
  if ($paragraph.is(':hidden')) {
    $paragraph.show();
    $link.text('Click to hide');
  }
  // Hide the paragraph if it's already showing.
  else {
    $paragraph.hide();
    $link.text('Click to show');
  }
}


<p>She tests it out in the Firebug console:<br>
toggle('toggler1', 'paragraph1');<br>
It works great! The link text changes and the paragraph toggles. "Now all I have to do is wire it up to the click event," thinks Sunny. "I'll get paragraph1 working, and then I'll iterate over the rest of them." So off she goes:</p>


$('a#toggler1').click(toggle('toggler1', 'paragraph1'));


<p>If you've written much JavaScript, you know what's going to happen when she clicks on that link: Exactly nothing. Eventually Sunny figures out her problem: The jQuery click() function, which you use to add a click event handler, takes a <i>function</i> argument. You can't pass it toggle('toggler1', 'paragraph1'). You have to pass the toggle function itself. JavaScript treats functions as first-class objects, and you pass them around just like any other object.</p>

<p>"But I can't pass just toggle—that doesn't have enough information! How am I supposed to pass in the parameters I need?" Sunny protests. She Googles around some more, and she finds out about the magic of closures! As it turns out, if you write a JavaScript function <i>inside</i> another function, the inner function can see all the variables in the outer function. "So that's why you see all these function () {} declarations inside other functions! Maybe I should turn toggler back into one of those." So she tries again:


$(document).ready(function () {
  var link_id = 'toggler1';
  var paragraph_id = 'paragraph1';
  $('#' + link_id).click(function () { 
    var $link = $('#' + link_id);
    var $paragraph = $('#' + paragraph_id);
    if ($paragraph.is(':hidden')) {
      $paragraph.show();
      $link.text('Click to hide');
    }
    else {
      $paragraph.hide();
      $link.text('Click to show');
    }
  });
});

<a id="toggler1">Click to hide</a>
<p id="paragraph1">Veggies sunt bona vobis, proinde vos postulo esse magis burdock groundnut salad bell pepper fennel turnip greens cabbage desert raisin caulie squash. Burdock horseradish epazote asparagus broccoli taro avocado kohlrabi wattle seed sweet pepper water spinach arugula bunya nuts grape. </p>



<p>Turns out that works fine. But there are still a couple of problems with it, one of which Sunny knows about, and one of which she has yet to discover:</p>

<li>This is going to quit working in a very odd way when she tries <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide/Closures#Creating_closures_in_loops:_A_common_mistake">iterating over it</a> to add the other paragraphs.</li>
<li>When Sunny went from having a nice, clean, encapsulated toggle function to an anonymous inline function, her code suddenly became harder to read, harder to document, and harder to maintain.</li>
</ol>

<p>I won't expound on problem #1; there are several ways to solve it (including wrapping her code in yet another (function(){})(), oh joy!). What I want to deal with here is problem #2:</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous inline functions like the one in the second example are hard to read, hard to document, and hard to maintain.</strong></p>
<p>Often developers like Sunny use them because they don't see any other way to get to the data they need. But there's a perfectly good alternative pattern.</p>

Step 1: Use an object

<p>Just like in other programming languages, objects in JavaScript are a good way to keep data and methods together. Sunny can write her object constructor like this:</p>

Toggler = function (linkId, paragraphId) {
  this.$link = $('#' + linkId);
  this.$paragraph = $('#' + paragraphId);
};


<p>To add methods, you add them to the object's prototype:</p>


Toggler.prototype.toggle = function () {
    if (this.$paragraph.is(':hidden')) {
      this.$paragraph.show();
      this.$link.text('Click to hide');
    }
    else {
      this.$paragraph.hide();
      this.$link.text('Click to show');
    }
  });
};


<p>When Sunny wants a new instance of Toggler, she can instantiate it like this:</p>

var toggler1 = new Toggler('toggle-link-1', 'paragraph-1');

Step 2: Function.prototype.bind (or jQuery.proxy)

<p>So now we have an object, which is fine and dandy, but we still have the same problem Sunny had when she tried passing toggle('toggle-link', 'paragraph'): How do we turn toggler1.toggle into something we can pass into jQuery's click() method? The answer is Function.prototype.bind. It's a new JavaScript feature (introduced in ECMAScript 5) that lets you package up a method on an object instance, together with the instance itself, and turn the whole thing into a first-class function you can use as an event handler. Here's how it works:</p>

var toggler1 = new Toggler('toggle-link-1', 'paragraph-1');
var click_handler = toggler1.toggle.bind(toggler1); // &lt;-- this is the magic invocation!
$('a#toggle-link-1').click(click_handler);


<p>That .bind() call is the key to this whole pattern. It's a method on the built-in Function object's prototype. Its superpower is that it lets Sunny specify what she wants this to equal when her method gets called. The this keyword is always supposed to refer to the object that your function is a method of—just like it does in Java or PHP or any number of other languages—but in JavaScript, it doesn't always work that way. For example, if you create a click handler without using .bind() on it, you'll find that this is a reference to the link that got clicked! That's pretty crazy behavior for anyone familiar with object-oriented programming. Fortunately, by using .bind() on your object methods, you can keep the meaning of this sane.</p>

<p>One thing to be aware of is that older browsers don't have Function.prototype.bind available natively. This includes IE8, FF3.6, and all versions of Safari. So for those browsers, you have to provide your own definition of Function.prototype.bind. Mozilla has a handy <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind#Compatibility">polyfill</a> you can use. It won't hurt anything in modern browsers, and it'll make .bind() work correctly in older ones.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you have jQuery 1.4 or higher available, you can use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/">jQuery.proxy</a> in much the same way:</p>

var toggler1 = new Toggler('toggle-link-1', 'paragraph-1');
var click_handler = $.proxy(toggler1.toggle, toggler1);
$('a#toggle-link-1').click(click_handler);


<p>I don't really recommend jQuery.proxy in most cases. It tries to keep track of your bound functions for you, so you can unbind them later even without a reference to your function object, and that can cause problems if you're creating multiple event handlers (say, one for each toggle link on the page, which is Sunny's use case). I do often use it when writing JavaScript for Drupal, though, since Drupal doesn't have Function.prototype.bind available (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1025626">yet!</a>).</p>

Putting it together

<p>Here's how Sunny could write her toggler code using objects and Function.prototype.bind:</p>


$(document).ready(function () {
  /**
   * Object constructor for the Toggler object.
   */
  Toggler = function (linkId, paragraphId) {
    this.$link = $('#' + linkId);
    this.$paragraph = $('#' + paragraphId);
    // Bind a click handler to the link.
    var clickHandler = this.toggle.bind(this);
    this.$link.click(clickHandler);
  };

  /**
   * Toggle the paragraph's visibility.
   */
  Toggler.prototype.toggle = function () {
    // Show the paragraph if it's hidden.
    if (this.$paragraph.is(':hidden')) {
      this.$paragraph.show();
      this.$link.text('Click to hide');
    }
    // Hide the paragraph if it's visible.
    else {
      this.$paragraph.hide();
      this.$link.text('Click to show');
    }
  };
  // Create Toggler objects for each link and paragraph. In real life you
  // would iterate over a list of some kind.
  new Toggler('toggle-link-1', 'paragraph-1');
  new Toggler('toggle-link-2', 'paragraph-2');
});
<p><a id="toggle-link-1">Click to hide</a></p>
<p id="paragraph-1">Skateboard quis et vegan cliche lomo messenger bag, mcsweeney's mollit lo-fi american apparel sint tofu blog. Etsy wolf PBR irony nesciunt, scenester ut mollit freegan cosby sweater mixtape viral vero. Tofu culpa freegan magna, non aute bicycle rights dolor gentrify DIY esse. </p>
<p><a id="toggle-link-2">Click to hide</a></p>
<p id="paragraph-2">Sockeye salmon. Saber-toothed blenny flagfish banded killifish dragonfish goldeye boga fathead sculpin sargassum fish. Unicorn fish sandperch zebra bullhead shark Atlantic saury. Panga goby, “darter tripletail,” barreleye walleye rockweed gunnel southern flounder.</p>


<p>Obviously this isn't the most efficient way to implement a toggle link—there are lots of better ways to do it (jQuery toggle(), for one!). The point here is to illustrate how .bind() lets you write object-oriented JavaScript that respects the this keyword. It's a technique that could eliminate a lot of undocumented anonymous functions if more people knew about it.</p>

<p>I'm especially interested in getting more people in the Drupal community familiar with this pattern, so if you maintain a Drupal module and you want to give this a try, come find me on IRC in #drupal-contribute and I'll be happy to help. I've also proposed a <a href="http://pnwdrupalsummit.org/sessions/javascript-workshop-code-refactored-while-you-wait">workshop</a> at the Pacific Northwest Drupal Summit where we'll be refactoring JavaScript from the audience. If you're coming to the summit and you have some JavaScript you're not proud of, bring it by for a few small repairs!</p>

    <p>A number of concerns have been voiced from the community about the substantial growth Acquia has achieved since its inception, the number of key contributors who are now employed by Acquia, and the subsequent influence that this allows Acquia to have on the project.</p>
<p>While some of these concerns have validity, I also think there is also a fair share of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) being spread. So, let's clear up a few points.</p>
<p>In terms of growth, Acquia currently employs about 150 people. However, fewer than half of Acquia's employees work directly with Drupal; the majority of Acquians work in sales, marketing, hosting operations, finance, HR, etc. In a way, this makes us smaller than Phase2, Node One, Forum One, Propeople, Capgemini, and dozens of other shops in terms of Drupal staff. We have a different mix than most other Drupal shops.</p>
<p>In terms of influence, Acquia employs fewer than 10% of the contributors to Drupal core. Admittedly, on a "per Drupalist" basis, Acquia probably contributes significantly more code and magnitudes more dollars to the Drupal community than any other organization.  We are investing in expanding the Drupal community through major learning initiatives.  We sponsor more DrupalCamps, where new people are introduced to Drupal, than anyone. We sponsor more interns than perhaps the rest of the community combined, where high school and university students learn how to build a career in Drupal. Not to mention we contribute a lot of code.  </p>
<p>I like to believe that is a great thing for Drupal and that not doing so would be a big loss for all of us.</p>
<p>It certainly helps to have venture capital money when making investments in the community, but it is not a magic bullet either. It is not free money. I've explicitly chosen to give up part of my equity in Acquia in exchange for money so that I can invest it back into the Drupal community to help Drupal advance.</p>
<p>I understand that my involvement with Acquia is tricky because its well-being is intertwined with Drupal's. But I help drive the decision-making process at Acquia, and I set those directions with the best interests of Drupal in mind at all times. Making Drupal successful and Drupal's <em>well-being</em> is my primary concern, regardless of the "hat" that I wear. We want Drupal to power as many sites as possible, both small and large. We want lots of Drupal entrepreneurs to thrive in a growing ecosystem. If you look at Acquia's actions, you'll see tons of  contributions here. We sponsor DrupalCamps and DrupalCons, and pay employees to improve Drupal modules and themes.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://buytaert.net/why-acquia-acquired-cyrve-and-gvs">our acquisitions of Cyrve and GVS</a> have been a topic of debate.  I'd like to point out that acquisitions are a two-way street: they don't happen unless both parties are really excited about it. Contributors come to Acquia for different reasons. Sometimes they would rather hand things like business development, sales, and support off to someone more set up for that, so they can stay focused on doing things they really enjoy. Others thrive more in a larger team of smart people working on interesting things, rather than toiling away on their own. Still others have put in huge amounts of their own personal time over a sustained period to help improve Drupal, often at great personal sacrifice, and are looking for an arrangement that makes this commitment to the project more sustainable. Painting these contributors as "bad guys", or the company who allows them to pursue a career that they love as "bad guys", is not healthy for our community, or the individuals involved.</p>
<p>The clear solution to the influence concern is to grow our community, particularly our contributor community. If more individuals and Drupal shops are contributing in a bigger way, this mitigates the risks of <em>any</em> organization, Acquia or otherwise, from exerting too much influence on the overall project.</p>
<p>So as a community, we need to re-frame this question. We need to be asking ourselves: (1) What can we do to grow the community? (2) Why aren't more people who depend on Drupal contributing to it? and (3) How can we encourage Drupal shops to contribute back?</p>  </div>

    <p>As followers of this blog, you might have read that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/16/acquia-expands-drupal-product-suite-with-purchases-of-cyrve-growing-venture-solutions/">Acquia acquired two Drupal companies</a>; security specialist <a href="http://growingventuresolutions.com/blog/gvs-drupal-scout-acquired-industry-leader-acquia">Growing Venture Solutions</a> and migration expert <a href="http://cyrve.com/acquia">Cyrve</a>.   We wanted to do these acquisitions because they create a win-win-win situation; it is beneficial for the Drupal community, our partners and our customers.  I personally championed and led those acquisitions so I want to take a moment to explain why.</p>
How do these acquisitions affect Drupal?
<p>I believe these acquisitions benefit Drupal by expanding its reach. Migration from legacy systems (like Vignette, RedDot and Interwoven) and from expensive enterprise solutions (like Jive Software, Adobe CQ5 and Sitecore) represents some of Drupal's biggest opportunities -- if not the biggest.  My hope is that by acquiring and expanding Cyrve, we'll be able to bring more projects into Drupal. That leads to more site building work, more contributed module patches, and more people talking about their Drupal successes.  </p>
<p>Similarly, Acquia's involvement in GVS gives it the resources it needs to pursue new security initiatives that will make Drupal more attractive to everybody. As always, we'll continue to return many developments to the community.</p>
How do these acquisitions affect Acquia's customers?
<p>Acquia's customer base has been growing rapidly, both in number and size. We plan to use these acquisitions to provide our customers with more product options and more experts. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer automated, self-service security tools as part of the <a href="https://acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network">Acquia Network</a>.</li>
<li>Integrate the services of both companies into our <a href="https://acquia.com/products-services/acquia-professional-services">Professional Services</a> group.  We'll be expanding our security and migration teams, both by training existing consultants and by bringing new employees into the fold.</li>
<li>Incorporate their curricula into our existing materials so we can help train many more experts on Drupal security and Drupal migrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are good for Acquia's customers. But they're also good for the Drupal community at large: we need more migrations and security experts in the community.</p>
How do these acquisitions affect Acquia's partners?
<p>Many of our partners build Drupal websites, but few have in-house security or migration expertise. With Cyrve and GVS, we can all approach joint customers with more-complete offerings.  This enables our partners to go after bigger projects.</p>
<p>In short, I believe these acquisitions are beneficial for Drupal, our partners and our customers. However, some people have expressed concerns that, with these acquisitions, Acquia is sucking up a lot of the Drupal talent. Because that concern is not limited to these acquisitions, I've decided to address that in a separate blog post: <a href="http://buytaert.net/does-acquia-suck-up-all-the-drupal-talent">Does Acquia suck up all the Drupal talent?</a>.</p>  </div>

Many of the small businesses I deal with have never run a site and are terrified by the prospect. </p>
<p>I was really impressed when I saw the HTML5 Aloha editor <a href="http://aloha-editor.com">http://aloha-editor.com</a>, but was frustrated that the work on a D7 module has stalled.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy hand rolling their own the first thing is to embed the plugins and javascripts into your desired template eg:</p>
&lt;head&gt; ...<br />&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="aloha/aloha/aloha.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="aloha/aloha/plugins/com.gentics.aloha.plugins.Format/plugin.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="aloha/aloha/plugins/com.gentics.aloha.plugins.Table/plugin.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="aloha/aloha/plugins/com.gentics.aloha.plugins.List/plugin.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;
<p>then to make parts of your Drupal website editable<br />
Define using css selectors like style which part/contents of the web page should be editable by Aloha Editor. For example, if you want to edit</p>
&lt;div id="content"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
<p>you should define it like this:</p>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />$(function(){<br />  $('#content').aloha();<br />});<br />&lt;/script&gt;
<p>also, if you want to edit all elements of the class "editme" you should define it like that:</p>
$('.editme').aloha();
<br /><br />For those who prefer a simple solution
<p>An example can be seen (and used) at <a href="http://inlineedit.venturacottage.com">http://inlineedit.venturacottage.com</a> (user and password are demo)</p>
<p>I have paid a programmer to develop a <a href="/shop/aloha-inline-editor-module" target="_blank" title="Aloha inline editor module">D7 module</a> for this.<br /><br /><br /></p>

    <p>The following technique and many of the tools were developed/improved by <a href="http://reviewdriven.com/">ReviewDriven</a>.</p>
Problems
<p>The <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules--field--field.module/group/field/7">field API</a> in <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> 7 combined with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> is very powerful combination. Yet there are certain data structures that are difficult or inefficient to work with using the two tools. One such structure is tables of data with multiple columns which can be stored using the fields API, but have a number of issues that arise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Field data is loaded every time the entity is loaded which can be catastrophic with large datasets.
<ul>
<li>For example, when editing a node with a large dataset attached each value has a corresponding field element generated which eats up memory and processing power quickly and can easily cause white screens.</li>
<li>When viewing a node even if the fields are hidden the data is loaded and again is a tax on memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Relationship between columns is not exported to Views, since it has no way to know, which limits the way values may be displayed.</li>
<li>Aggregating columns in Views cannot be done across entities.</li>
<li>Views loads field data through the field API which is inefficient for large datasets, but ensures that display formatters and such are respected.</li>
</ul>
Solutions
<p>Thankfully, there are a number of tools that can be utilized to solve each of these problems and in combination provide a very powerful way to handle tables of data and aggregation across entities.</p>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/field_suppress">Field suppress</a>
<p>From the Field suppress project page.</p>
<p>
Suppress field data from being loaded during entity_load(). Since field data will not be loaded it will not be displayed nor editable through the interface. This can be handy if you are using an alternate means to display or edit data and/or if you have a large amount of data in fields which will cause the node edit (or similar) interface to use a huge amount of memory and take a very long time to build.
</p>
<p>Field suppress solves the first problem, but data will then need to be edited directly through code and manually displayed (ex. Views).</p>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/field_group_views">Field group views</a>
<p>The next problem requires an interface/API for defining relationships between fields (or columns). Relationships can be defined using Field group views which is a plugin for <a href="http://drupal.org/project/field_group">Field group</a> which provides both a UI and exportables for defining groups of fields. A display group can be defined and the plugin set to Views which will then export the proper relationships to Views and generate a stub view which can then be customized. The view will automatically replace the fields when displaying the entity. A requirement of Field group views is Views field which actually solves the last two problems.</p>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_field">Views field</a>
<p>Views field exposes the field tables and revision field tables to Views as base tables. Using the field base tables means that field data can be loaded directly instead of going through the field API. Loading data directly is much more efficient (especially for large datasets) and allows for aggregation across multiple entities, but losses the formatting capabilities of the fields API (could possibly add support for formatting to Views field). Formatting can also be added to the exposed field base table through hook_views_data_alter() in the following manor.<br />
&lt;?php<br />/**<br />&nbsp;*&nbsp;Implements&nbsp;hook_views_data_alter().<br />&nbsp;*/<br />function&nbsp;conduit_views_data_alter(&amp;$data)&nbsp;{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;//&nbsp;May&nbsp;not&nbsp;always&nbsp;be&nbsp;'_value'&nbsp;depending&nbsp;on&nbsp;field&nbsp;type.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;$data['field_data_MY_FIELD']['MY_FIELD_value']['field']['handler']&nbsp;=&nbsp;'views_handler_HANDLER';<br />}<br />?&gt;</p>
<p><em>Please note, there are two <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/views_field?categories=bug">bugs</a> that cause annoyances due to changes in the Views API, but do no prevent Views field from working. Feel free to submit patches.<em></em></em></p>
Example
<p>I have utilized these tools in combination on a number of projects with quite satisfying results, but I will attempt to provide a few generic examples to provide a clearer picture of how these tools can be used.</p>
Tallying summary results
<p>If you have a collection of entities and you want to be able to group the overall field data and perform SQL operations like COUNT() or SUM() Views field makes it easy. The core poll module could be rewritten using this technique so we will use poll as an example (could be done many ways).</p>
<p>Say you have a node type for "Foo" poll entries that looks something like the following.</p>
<p><u>poll_foo_entry</u></p>
<ul>
<li>poll_foo_value: customizable field capable of storing the value for a poll, in this case lets go with a text field</li>
</ul>
<p>Results can be calculated using a view with the base table poll_foo_value and aggregation enabled. The poll_foo_value column can be used as the group by column and additional columns can be added for determining the COUNT(). You could even then display the results using a chart plugin for views.</p>
<p>I used this technique to create <a href="http://survey.reviewdriven.com/results" title="http://survey.reviewdriven.com/results">http://survey.reviewdriven.com/results</a>. The tallied results are display on the left.</p>
Table of data
<p>Another powerful usecase is storing and displaying a table of data. Lets use a simple example of storing temperature data over time on nodes (possibly a node per region). A possible node structure is as follows.</p>
<p><u>temperature_history</u></p>
<ul>
<li>title: region or some such</li>
<li>date: mulivalue <a href="http://drupal.org/project/date">date</a> field</li>
<li>temperature: mulivalue <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1188262">temperature</a> field</li>
</ul>
<p>The date and temperature fields can then be related using Field group views by placing them in the same group and displayed using a view. The fields are related based on each fields delta. In other words the data is stored using the field API in the following manor.</p>
<p><ol><li>date[0] = 2011-09-01</li><li>date[1] = 2011-09-02</li><li>date[2] = 2011-09-03</li><li>date[3] = 2011-09-04</li><li>date[4] = 2011-09-06</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>temperature[0] = 70</li><li>temperature[1] = 69</li><li>temperature[2] = 68</li><li>temperature[3] = 67</li><li>temperature[4] = 66</li></ol></p>
<p>The number in brackets being the delta which allows the tables to be joined intelligently and produce a table like the following.</p>


Date
Temperature


2011-09-01
70


2011-09-02
69


2011-09-03
68


2011-09-04
67


2011-09-06
66


Improvements
<p>There are still some areas for improvement, but one only has so much time.</p>
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/pbs">Per-Bundle Storage</a>
<p>Storing related field data in a single table allows for the removal of overlapping columns and removes the need to join multiple tables. A field group could then be placed in a separate bundle or otherwise exposed to PBS and stored together in a single table. The database scheme would then be much more manageable and easier to query manually.</p>
Editing
<p>Being able to edit the dataset using a view would also be a major plus. There a number of modules that provide functionality of this sort, but not in such a flexible manor. Something like <a href="http://drupal.org/project/editview">Editview</a> would complete Field group views functionality. Large datasets could then be paginated for editing to prevent overload.</p>
Exciting usage
<p>Given that Views is plugable virtually an data structure could be displayed using this technique. The advantage over writing a one off field is that the structure is then easy to extend and modify, and requires little to no code to create. Simply export the fields, and field group definitions.</p>
<p>Fields such as the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/name">Name field</a> could be turned into a collection of fields displayed using a view and editable (assuming that gets implemented) using a similar structure.</p>
<p>The possibilities opened up by this technique are quite exciting and I look forward to seeing what people come up with.</p>  </div>

  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>One of the first things we do when supporting a site or reviewing it for security is look for modifications to the code.</p>
<p>We use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/hacked">Hacked</a> module to achieve this because it works quickly and automates a lot of the work in what is a normally very tedious process.</p>
<p>Here's some basic usage:</p>
Step 0. Remove any .git or CVS or .svn or...directories from your site
<p>The Hacked module currently gets somewhat <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1065996">confused</a> if there are both CVS directories and a .info file that has newer information. Now that the git migration is over I can see this potentially happening with .git directories and just to be sure you're working with a clean slate you should remove .svn directories. These metadata directories make manual diffing comparing a site's version of a module to a freshly downloaded tarball a little harder.</p>
<p>So, you should make sure you're working with a temporary throw-away version of of the site code and then run a command something like this from the root of the site (i.e. where index.php lives):</p>
<p>
</p> find ./ -name ".svn" -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;<br /> find ./ -name ".git" -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;<br /> find ./ -name "CVS" -type d -exec rm -rf {} \;

<p>That will recursively find directories you no longer want and remove them. Remember, only do this from inside the Drupal root on a copy of the site where you are OK losing information.</p>
Step 1. Review the results of the hacked report
<p>I prefer to run the command via the command line rather than the user interface. This requires the excellent <a href="">Drush</a> module.</p>
<p>The command to view the list of modified files is:</p>
<p>drush hlp</p>
<p>That will create some output like:</p>
<p>
</p>Title                  Name                    Version        Status     Changed  Deleted <br />Drupal                 drupal                  Drupal 6.19    Unchecked  0        0<br />Administration menu    admin_menu              6.x-3.0-alpha4 Changed    1        0<br />Apache Solr Search     apachesolr              6.x-1.2        Changed    28       0<br />Better Exposed Filters better_exposed_filters  6.x-1.0        Changed    6        0<br />Better Formats         better_formats          6.x-1.2        Changed    4        0<br />Checkbox Validate      checkbox_validate       6.x-2.1        Changed    3        0<br />Chaos tool suite       ctools                  6.x-1.7        Changed    1        0<br />Deployment             deploy                  6.x-1.x-dev    Changed    17       0

Step 2. Get precise details with "hacked diff"
Step 3. Compare the module using a tarball or git
<p>If you're still not sure what's going on you can <em>potentially</em> compare the module on the site to a module from drupal.org. Look in the module's .info file for information like:</p>
<p>
</p>; Information added by drupal.org packaging script on 2010-07-02<br />version = "6.x-1.1"<br />core = "6.x"<br />project = "ife"<br />datestamp = "1278062408"

<p>If it's a stable release (i.e. the version doesn't end in a .dev) then you can just download it. Use the "View all releases" link from the module page to find older versions if the module has been updated from the version you are working with.</p>
<p>I like to download the fresh modules into a directory in my sites/all/modules/ folder called "fresh_copy".</p>
<p>If it's a dev release you can you use that datestamp value to figure out when it's from. First you will need to make a local copy of the git repository. Here are the commands I used for Mollom module:</p>
<p>
</p> cd sites/all/modules/fresh_copy/<br /> git clone --branch 6.x-1.x http://git.drupal.org/project/mollom.git

<p>From there you will now checkout the version of the code from a specific date. You can change the datestamp value to a normal date using the date command. Then use that in a git command to get a copy of the code from that date:</p>
<p>cd mollom<br />
  date -d @1288656895<br />
  Mon Nov  1 18:14:55 MDT 2010<br />
  git checkout git rev-list -n 1 --before="2010-11-01 18:14" 6.x-1.x</p>
<p>Now that you've got the files locally, I like to compare them with the diff command:</p>
<p>
</p> diff -rupw ife ../ife/

<p>The -rupw options will make it run recursively on the directories, showing the output in a standard Drupal unidiff format, and ignore whitespace changes that might have been introduced by certain text editors even though they don't really change the file.</p>
<p>If you're lucky, the output will be something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.drupalscout.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/field/article-images/Selection_2049.png" /></p>
<p>Now you have to read through the changes and see if they are real or not and you can see a little about what you might need to do about those changes.</p>
<p>As you can see from the later steps in this article there is a lot of manual busy-work to do a proper analysis comparing local modules to those on drupal.org. Thankfully the Hacked! module makes the initial job a good bit faster.</p>

<p>One of the things about maturing software is that there is lots of legacy code based on decisions that were made long ago. Oftentimes this is refactored or removed, but sometimes the concepts are so deep that they are there to stay. Something that has been rattling around in my brain for a while is a question about what we would do differently if we started Drupal today. There are tools that are available today that weren't available 10 years ago and the web has fundamentally changed since then. There are many things that should be done the same but other things that it would be nice to have a do over on. </p>
<p>The purpose of the post is not to call for a fork or to start a new project. It is to take a step back and look at the project as a whole and not from a legacy standpoint. Hopefully it will allow us to see the forest for the trees.</p>
Things done well
Node/Entity Concept
<p>The idea that (almost) everything is a node, and in Drupal 7 everything is an entity, is one of the best design decisions made by the Drupal community. Having used several CMSes before Drupal, I know the pain of the other way. In other systems I'd install the blog module and the forum module. They didn't talk to each other or know anything about each other. All the data was stored in their own tables in unique ways. If I wanted to add a five-star rating system, I'd have to hope that someone had written a five-star expansion for the blog and a different one (that kinda-sorta worked the same) for the forum. The great thing about nodes and entities is that they allow items on your website to all be extensible in the same way. Those who have never used other systems may not fully appreciate how big of a deal this really is.</p>
Easily Extensible
<p>Regardless of what type of extensibility system a software system uses, it needs to be easy and pervasive. Drupal has done this remarkably well. I often tell new programmers that if they are writing more than 5 lines of code to do something they are doing it wrong. The fact that we can do some many tweaks with so little code is a testament to how well done the extensibility system is. Regardless of what happens in Drupal 8, 9 or 34, it needs to remain very easy to extend.</p>
Great Site Building Tools
<p>One of the things that really sets Drupal apart is the site building tools. The ability to create content types, define fields, set up displays and generate views of data; without having to write one line of code is one of the most amazing things Drupal has achieved. Think about that for a second. In the past people had to hire a programmer who created database tables and wrote SQL queries with libraries to fetch, parse and deal with html and forms. Programmers are no longer needed to achieve that in Drupal and it can be done with nothing more than a web browser. This will be one of the lasting legacies of Drupal. Figuring out some of the UI needed to do complex system designs.</p>
Users/Roles/Permissions
<p>Another thing that Drupal really pioneered on the web was the users/roles/permissions system that allow for fine grained (but manageable) control of users. Prior to this most CMSes were designed around building out brochure ware or static type websites. Drupal, being "community plumbing," did a great job designing from the ground up around users and permissions. While there are still ways it could improve, the general design is awesome and still far ahead of other popular systems out there.</p>
Community
<p>To anyone who is not involved in the community: you are missing out. Drupal has by far the most amazing community around a software product that I have ever been involved in. People are genuinely helpful and available and there are fun and exciting groups all over the place. There are regular camps and cons that push the envelope forward and drupal.org is a good (and improving) place for collaboration. Without the community Drupal would be only fraction of what it is today.</p>
Things done differently
Ruby vs PHP
<p>If Drupal were started today, hopefully we would choose a different language. PHP has it's advantages in that it is easy to understand and very forgiving. While this encourages new and inexperienced programmers, it also encourages bugs. PHP is also growing up as a language (finally adding proper objects). But still has lots of <a href="http://technosophos.com/content/php-arrays-are-not-arrays">little</a> <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=55439">crazinesses</a>. Hopefully we would choose a language like Ruby that is an absolute joy to write and was properly designed from the beginning. How many times have you written if&#40;! something&#41;? In Ruby you can do unless&#40;something&#41;. If you haven't gotten to know Ruby yet, try it out and be amazed. I really wish Drupal was written in Ruby instead of PHP.</p>
Base on existing framework
<p>The old debate about Drupal being a framework or a CMS is a good one. It is a bit of both but not a terribly good programming framework. There is a lot of work being done trying to clean up lots of the APIs but compared to "real" programming frameworks there is still a lot of work to do. This begs the question of why it doesn't just use another framework. There have been discussions about leveraging other frameworks more for some of the core initiatives. I'd hope that if we were starting Drupal today we could pick a framework to base it on. For PHP it could be Zend or Symphony and for Ruby maybe Rails.</p>
REST server based
<p>One of the fundamental changes to the web is that sites are no longer just html pages. They are more of a repository for company information that has to interact with multiple devices, the desktop browser being one of them. Designing around this paradigm would need to be paramount if starting Drupal today. Everything should be done as a REST server and the web server would be one of many ways to display the data. I'm very glad that Dries has identified this as an important Core initiative but I wonder if we can really decouple everything to the amount needed without a complete rewrite. If we were starting from scratch this would be much simpler to do.</p>
Object Oriented
<p>Drupal is inherently not object oriented and this really hurts it. Passing around massive data arrays as configuration is a pseudo object oriented system that is very easy to break and lacks many of the benefits of a true object oriented system. Again, if we were starting today we would definitely need to do everything object based to add integrity and order to some of the things going on.</p>
MVC Seperation
<p>Drupal is very easy to use but does a terrible job separating out the parts of the MVC framework. A great example of this is the Form API. It should primarily be part of the View and pass the logic to the controller. For example, on a node form submit it should call node_save() (the controller) and the node_save() should report back whether or not there was an error. The Form API would then either render a successful response or redo the form with the errors. The concept of having validate and submit handlers in the form is a bad idea. It is a mix of the view and controller and makes it very difficult to do any controller work apart from the Form API. Try saving a node without doing a drupal_execute! It is getting better but properly separating these concepts would go a very long way towards cleaning things up.</p>
Separate Site Building From Site Admin
<p>Our admin section is primarily geared around building out the site. The site administration is tacked into the middle of it. This produces a very confusing interface for the average system admin. We constantly have feedback from our clients that it is too difficult to understand. A big reason for this is that there are way more options than they need. What we should do if starting Drupal today is to split these into two different admin areas. One for Site Building tasks and the other for Site Administration tasks. Any changes to the structure or design should be in the Site Building tasks and site admins should only be given a very simple interface for administering the site. This is probably something we could do today with Drupal 7/8 but would be a must if starting over today.</p>
<p>One of the things that drew me (and many others) to Drupal was not only its power but how easy it was to program and understand. The only thing I worry about some of the items listed above and the D8 core initiatives is that they will/are making it more difficult for beginners to really understand what is going on and contribute. This is a nasty tradeoff and one that will need to be managed carefully.</p>
<p>What thoughts do you have? What else did Drupal get right? What else would we do differently if we started again today?</p>
