    <p>One of the best aspects about Drupal is its interoperability. Drupal can be integrated with almost all systems(CMS/ECM/DM)out there. There are so many ways to import content from other systems to Drupal. How you implement it will depend on some factors(budget, time constraint, 3rd party system constraints). If you need to consume a JSON feed and convert them into nodes, try using feeds module in conjunction with feeds_jsonpath_parser module. Use feeds to consume data from a given URL and feeds_jsonpath_parser to traverse through the JSON data and map elements to CCK fields.</p>

    <p>This screencast builds on the <a href="http://www.commerceguys.com/resources/articles/255">previous screencast showing selling a role</a>. This time, though, we're going to sell an individual node. Here's the recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have Content Access and its submodule Content Access Rules enabled</li>
<li>Create a content type called Premium Content</li>
<li>Instead of granting access to that entire content type by role, grant it on a user-by-user, node-by-node basis</li>
<li>Add a nodereference field to our product; each product that sells access to a node should have the nodereference set to the content in question.</li>
<li>Add a rule (and component)
<ul>
<li>When the order is updated</li>
<li>If its state is Completed</li>
<li>Loop through the line items (invoke a component)</li>
<li>If the line item has a product reference field</li>
<li>If the Product has a nodereference field</li>
<li>Grant access to the node listed in the nodereference to the user who created the order.</li>

    <p>In this screencast we'll use Drupal's built-in access control mechanisms (using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/content_access">Content Access</a> module) to grant access to premium content to users who have a "premium" role.</p>
<p>Here's the recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable Content Access and the ACL (optional) module.</li>
<li>Create a role called "premium"</li>
<li>Create a content type called "Premium Content" and put some great content in it.</li>
<li>Verify that users can only access the premium content if they have the premium role.</li>
<li>Create a product representing the premium role.</li>
<li>Create a rule that grants the premium role on order completion:
<ul>
<li>After updating an order</li>
<li>If the order state is Completed</li>
<li>And the order contains our premium product</li>
<li>Add a role to the user who is the owner of the order</li>

<p>Why do you want a website? Because everyone else has one? That's a really terrible reason. Websites really a tools to accomplish a goal. Too many companies set out to build a website without fulling thinking this through.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>At company A there is general consensus that the website that was built in 1997 is way out of date as no one has changed anything in 5 years. A budget is put together and a marketing person is put in charge of finding someone to build a new website. After all, everyone else is building new websites so clearly this company needs a new one as well.</p>
<p>The company asks itself, "what do we want in a new website?" It then starts putting together a list of ideas they have for the new website. Lots of people have ideas of what they want, plus they should have this new social thingy as well. They hire a company like LevelTen to help them. </p>
<p>We go through a process where the company picks what colors they like, what mood board they like and what design and layout they want. We help them write the copy they want around the keywords they picked out.</p>
<p>In the end we give them the site they wanted but <strong><em>not the site they needed</em></strong>.</p>
<p>So where did this process go wrong? </p>
<p>Really right at the beginning. The question that was asked was, "What does company A want in their new website?" That is the wrong question. They aren't building the website for themselves. They are building for their customer. The question that should have been asked is, "What do Company A's <strong>customers</strong> want in the company's new website?"</p>
<p>They don't really want a new website. What they want is to accomplish some goal. Often this is engaging their customer or selling more products online. In order to do this you need to make a website for your customer, not for your organization.</p>
<p>By starting the process thinking about the customer, continuing the process thinking about the customer and ending the process thinking about the customer you can finally create a website that the customer actually wants. </p>
<p>Think about the design process for a minute. Often times we start with a mood board. How does your mood board get chosen? Does a committee get together and try and pick some colors that they like the best? Is there a <a href="http://theprotagonist5.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/hippo-the-highest-paid-persons-opinion-in-marketing/" target="_blank">HiPPO</a> (highest paid person's opinion) in the room who makes the decision?</p>
<p>Why not do customer research and decide which colors best serve your companies purposes? What if the color of the site could increase sales from 5% to 10%? Would this be an important part to get right? Of course!</p>
<p>Many people don't realize how important so many of these decisions really are but they make them on guesswork and intuition. While it's possible to get the choice right by intuition, the chances of failure are too great to risk it.</p>
<p>Every aspect of the website should be selected and designed to maximize the goals of the website whether that is total number of readers, signing up for a newsletter or selling a particular product.</p>
<p>So what aspects should be tested against your customers before you make your decisions? </p>
<p>All of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Mood board</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Layout</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Targeted Keywords</li>
<li>Website Copy</li>
<li>Features (Blog, Forum, News, etc)</li>
<li>Page Titles</li>
<li>Meta Information</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty much every aspect of your website should be tested against customers of <em>your specific industry</em> or else you are just guessing.</p>
<p>What you really need is a <a href="http://www.leveltendesign.com/blog/tom/answering-how-can-i-get-results-oriented-website-tight-budget">Results Oriented Website</a> not just a new website.</p>

    <p><img src="http://drupal.cocomore.com/system/files/blog_photos/Drupal_Backward_Compatibility/dries_quote_regarding_compatibility.png" width="261" height="269" alt="[…] there are both advantages and disadvantages to backward compatibility. […] If you start dragging baggage along, your product will, eventually, be replaced by something that offers the same functionality but without the baggage. — Dries Buytaert, May 17 2006 (just after Drupal 4.7 release" title="[…] there are both advantages and disadvantages to backward compatibility. […] If you start dragging baggage along, your product will, eventually, be replaced by something that offers the same functionality but without the baggage. — Dries Buytaert, May 17 2006 (just after Drupal 4.7 release" class="right" />The topic of Drupal’s backward compatibility issues has come up in various ways over the years and has been an issue of debate in most cases. When we responded to Dries’s “<a href="http://buytaert.net/state-of-drupal-presentation-august-2011" title="State of Drupal presentation (August 2011) | Dries Buytaert">State of Drupal 2011</a>” survey, only about 8.2% of the community members who responded indicated that improving backward compatibility was one of Drupal’s “biggest challenges”. But this is actually a pretty large number of respondents, considering that there were 19 other options for the question, and we could only select three, and also considering that the majority of those who took the survey might not represent the majority of Drupal stakeholders who would most benefit from improved backward compatibility: people who might not work with Drupal full-time, and might not personally maintain any code, and who want to upgrade their sites to the next major versions, but cannot do so easily because of missing modules and the fact that, regardless of whether a module might be very close to compliant with the next major-version <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term115">API</a>, modules are only for one major Drupal version.</p> 

<p>If this lack of API backward compatibility were common with Windows or Mac applications, or Firefox plugins, or just about any other software written for a platform, far fewer people would make these upgrades or they would wait a very long time to do so (and might end up changing operating systems or browsers to avoid the headache). The opposite is actually true in the case of Mac apps; Apple has historically supported legacy code and legacy processor types with compatibility bridges which, although not particularly great for performance, at least allowed needed software to run. Firefox and Safari, my two most-used browsers, regularly release major updates which don't break every plugin (at least with Firefox, some add-ons are identified as incompatible and disabled until a compatible version is released). And <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term178">PHP</a> deprecates functions, but usually doesn’t make it impossible to use code that worked in the previous major PHP release. But Drupal introduces major changes that result in developers having to learn a whole new API just to get their modules or themes ready to run again. This made sense in the past for a variety of reasons, at least back when Drupal was still in diapers, but there might be sufficient reason, now, to revisit the issue and explore whether this approach still makes sense in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Lest it sound like I think this approach was always a bad idea, I should say that I do understand the logic behind breaking compatibility, at least historically. Too much attention to backward compatibility and it limits innovation, more bugs creep in, and the code starts to bloat. There are even <a href="http://erickennedy.org/Drupal-7-Reasons-to-Switch" title="7 reasons to switch from Drupal to Yii - Eric Kennedy">former Drupal developers</a> who claim they now work on slimmer platforms in order to avoid what they consider too much bloat in Drupal, already. It’s doubtful that Drupal would be as popular as it is today if the <a class="glossary-term" href="http://drupal.cocomore.com/glossary/8#term136">core</a> team had focused on maintaining backward compatibility in the API just to keep from breaking legacy code. But what worked in the early days of Drupal may not work so well when there are thousands of modules which are not considered high enough priority to port to the next major Drupal release and most larger Drupal sites seem to have at least one of those that they consider a necessity.</p>

For the purposes of this post, I’ve marked up the image to discuss a few points. Yes, there are “only” 269 respondents who chose backward compatibility as one of Drupal’s biggest challenges. But it is also arguable that this challenge is directly related to many of the other challenges which ranked higher:</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>I have been thinking back and forth of how to best put my thoughts down on “paper”.</p>
<p>This week, I had my last day of work with the Drupal Association.<br />
The Drupal Association is undergoing a lot of changes and this is a result of one of them. My position is being moved to Portland, Oregon, where the physical office of the Drupal Association is; and since I am halfway across the world from that place, I was let go.</p>
<p>I started working on DrupalCon Paris in 2009 and it became a heavy workload, which I was happy to do. The result was that I had a little burnout and my brain wouldn’t function for several days. Also, I barely remember the week itself, as I was sick and simply exhausted by the time all you guys flooded the halls. :-)<br />
Nonetheless, I enjoyed working on DrupalCon Paris so much, that I decided to remain involved as a volunteer and as someone, who had done it once, so I can share some experience and knowledge. At that point, it became a bit more personal, as many members of the Drupal community know. - We, volunteers, put a lot of extra effort and time into Drupal and its development, because we care, believe in its success, because we like working with enthusiastic and passionate people and want to make something happen.<br />
The road evidently led me to project-leading DrupalCon Copenhagen. I had the chance to be the link between the Drupal Association and the community. I considered it as part of my vision/understanding to represent the local community and to implement the maximum of their vision.<br />
Everything, that I built until then, I didn’t want to let go. I was lucky to find someone like NodeOne, which offered me 50% of my work time to be dedicated to community efforts with NodeOne’s involvement.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there were a lot of things happening within the DA; staff got hired, among others an events manager and sponsor manager and DrupalCon, starting with DrupalCon Chicago, became more professionally organised, something more like a model for future DrupalCons to be built upon.<br />
The Drupal Association needed more people to help with DrupalCons and I guess it was only a natural move to offer me a job as event coordinator.</p>
<p>I was very enthusiastic and motivated helping to better internal processes and documentation to make life easier for volunteers and to make DrupalCons even better for the community. However, there was little time (and little priority) to focus on long-term improvements. I had to focus on DrupalCon London, which had a higher priority.</p>
<p>I am not going to lie and say that everything was great, whilst working at the Drupal Association. There were misunderstandings, tensions, frustration, mis-communications, more frustration. I quickly realised, that I cannot do all I envisioned to do due to many reasons (no time and too many things, barriers, changes are hard).</p>
<p>Overall, I think, I have (had) a different approach on how to carry things forward. I think I always have considered myself as a representative for community interests and a link between the DA and the community volunteers, trying to implement and execute the conference to fulfil the needs and wishes of both sides. I also believe, that I have a very different approach in how to communicate and share information; I believe it is crucial to be as transparent as can be in an open source community. This makes it harder to manage people to get things done, true.</p>
<p>I guess it was time for me to go and to embrace something new. I am taking some time to reflect on what I want to do, whether it’ll be in Drupal or something entirely different. But just to make it clear: leaving the DA does not necessarily mean, that I’ll leave the Drupal community :-)</p>
<p>Despite what I wrote above (again, there is always good and bad), I learned a tremendous amount about working with other people, communication and processes. I thank the staff at the Drupal Association and DrupalCon volunteers for your knowledge, experience, support and wisdom in this journey.</p>
<p>A wonderful Christmas (or other) time!</p>  </div>

    <a href="/tags/mysql">mysql</a><a href="/tags/drupal">drupal</a><a href="/tags/drupal-planet">drupal planet</a><p>Our use case here is if you have a lot of data you want to insert in the MySQL - data that you might usually use the Drupal UI for, but there's so much of it you'd rather not if you can help it!</p>
<p>The example here is for a client of ours. For this particular client we have to launch a few new sites a month, each one comes with a new access list of email addresses to add to the Drupal "Access rules" page. There's no bulk upload, and doing these one by one with the UI is laborious, to say the least!</p>
<p>We could write a module, but it's an edge case really and it's pretty simple to deal with straight in MySQL. Enter the MySQL command, LOAD DATA INFILE.</p>
<p>First, your database user needs to be able to load the "infile". To do this, login as MySQL root and execute a command like this (for your user, obviously) to give your site's MySQL use file access permissions:</p>
<p>GRANT FILE ON *.* TO my_db_user@localhost;<br /></p>
<p>Next up we need to prep a file. Don't worry about putting strings in ' marks and all that - MySQL will sort itself out. It knows the data type of the column anyway. My input file looked like this (having copied and pasted a column of email addresses from a provided spreadsheet and used Replace in Gedit for Linux to provide the additional ,mail,1 at the end of each line):</p>
<p>someone@hotmail.com,mail,1<br />
foo@yahoo.com,mail,1<br />
barperson@gmail.com,mail,1<br />
bob@ymail.com,mail,1<br />
etc.<br /></p>
<p>I saved that on the server at ~/access-emails.txt - now to pass it to MySQL:</p>
<p>I used drush to login to MySQL with the drush sql-cli command from within the web root of the site and executed this command:</p>
<p>mysql&gt; LOAD DATA INFILE '/home/greg/access-emails.txt'<br />
INTO TABLE access<br />
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','<br />
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'<br />
(mask, type, status);</p>
<p>First bit is self-explanatory, as is the second. Then we tell MySQL what character the data is delimited by (I'm not sure on the default, so I explicitly stated a comma) and what a line ending looks like (again, not being sure of the default I explicitly stated a line break). Finally, and this is particularly important if there are auto_increment fields you need to deal with, which columns in MySQL the data in the rows maps to. In this case, the access table looks like this:</p>
<p>mysql&gt; DESCRIBE access;<br />
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+<br />
| Field  | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |<br />
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+<br />
| aid    | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |<br />
| mask   | varchar(255) | NO   |     |         |                |<br />
| type   | varchar(255) | NO   |     |         |                |<br />
| status | tinyint(4)   | NO   |     | 0       |                |<br />
+--------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+<br />
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)<br /></p>
<p>I don't want to provide the aid column, that's an auto_increment field, so I deliberately omit it from the end of the SQL statement so MySQL knows that data is not provided - so it will leave it NULL if it has no other instruction, or auto increment the ID if it's an auto_increment field.</p>
<p>That's it! Easy import of access data supplied by a client in a spreadsheet. 83 individual form operations done in a bit of pasting and replacing and a single SQL statement. \o/</p>

<p>If you've submitted a project for consideration in a Drupal.org project
application or issue queue, you may have received a review that looks something
like <a href="http://ventral.org/node/193/revisions/672/view">this</a>, a seemigly-endless stream of errors relating to
whitespace in comments, function argument documentation format, and horribly
malformed "else" statements.  We can thank <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupalcs">Drupal Code Sniffer</a> and
it's web-service offspring, the <a href="http://ventral.org/pareview">Automated project review</a> tool at
<a href="http://ventral.org/">ventral.org</a>, for much of this turn toward strict compliance reviewing. While
we all know that it's "the right way to go", it can often be quite discouraging
to hvae to churn through a list of what feels like miniscule issues in order to
share code with the community, especially when many of those issues are caused
by inconsistencies between standard code editor templates, documentation
auto-generators, and what Drupal.org requires. </p>

<p>The good news, though, is that we can get one step ahead of the review process,
and integrate these new tools into our development environment to ensure that
the code we write for Drupal is alway 100% compiant, from the start.</p>

<p>Drupal Code Sniffer is built on the widely-supported <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/redirected">PHP_CodeSniffer</a>
PEAR package and intended to be easily run w/o setting up an entire Drupal
instance (something that distinguishes it from <a href="http://drupal.org/project/coder">Coder</a>, for example).
This means that it can be integrated with any editor that has PHPCS integration.
The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupalcs">project page for DrupalCS</a> has instructions for integrating with
Eclipse, and integration with <a href="https://github.com/Drarok/php-codesniffer-tmbundle/">Textmate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/illusori/emacs-flymake-phpcs">Emacs</a> and
even <a href="http://onesandzeros.posterous.com/creating-a-coda-plugin-that-uses-pears-tools">Coda</a> should be possible with their existing PHPCS extensions
(see links).  </p>

<p>My editor of choice is Vim, however, and recent updates to the awesome
<a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">Sytastic</a> vim plugin make working with DrupalCS darn near
enjoyable...almost. I'll share the set up for in-editor standards checking here,
and then a few of the naughty regular expressions I put together to help take
care of some of the most, well, annoying, ones in bulk.</p>

<p>It's really pretty easy to set up Syntastic to automatically check your code
against Drupal coding standards.  Here's the quick step-by-step:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install Syntastic.  I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen</a> + <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/synchronizing-plugins-with-git-submodules-and-pathogen/">git
  submodules</a> approach for organizing plugins, and recommend
  it highly. You can use whatever approach works best for you (or is most
  coolest, as of the time you're reading this), but be sure to use
  <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/zipball/2.1.0">Syntastic 2.1</a> or <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic/tags">later</a>.  If you're
  using submodules to mannage your git plugins, this can be done by changing
  into your .vim/bundle/syntastic directory and running the command git
  checkout 2.1 (or whatever release is newest).</li>
<li>Install Drupal Code Sniffer.  The easiest way is to follow the
  installation instructions on the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupalcs">module's project page</a>: 
<ol>
<li>Make sure PEAR is installed.</li>
<li>Run pear install PHP_CodeSniffer.</li>
<li>Download DrupalCS (most recent version as of this writing can be
 downloaded <a href="http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drupalcs-7.x-1.x-dev.tar.gz">here</a>), and put it somewhere that makes
 sense (on *nix and OS X systems this is probably /usr/local/share,
 ~/bin or similar).</li>
<li>Symlink the DrupalCodingStandard directory in your DrupalCS install
 to the Standards dir in CodeSniffer with a command like sudo ln -sv
 /path/to/drupalcs/DrupalCodingStandard $(pear config-get
 php_dir)/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Then we need to tell Syntastic to use the Drupal coding standards when
   running PHP CodeSniffer.  To do this, add a few lines to your .vimrc
   file, telling Syntastic to use the DrupalCodingStandard standard and
   include the Drupal PHP extensions among those it subjects to its check:</p>

  let g:syntastic_phpcs_conf=" --standard=DrupalCodingStandard
  --extensions=php,module,inc,install,test,profile,theme"
</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's it! I also like to add some lines like <a href="https://gist.github.com/1481911">these</a> to my .vimrc to
get the most out of Syntastic via the statusline and such (note that these also
require the amazing Fugitive plugin to work as-is).</p>

<p>With this configuration, Syntastic will scan your file for potential coding
standards violations on evey save, and display indicators on any line that
triggers an error.  My editing environment looks something like this, then, with
a file that has some standards issues, after using the ":Errors" command to
bring up the error pane (note that these are due to cTool's Export UI's spec, in
this case):</p>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/100655036582022633110/albums/5686400503951493441/5686400502890312754"><img src="http://echodittolabs.org/files/drupalcs-vim-syntastic.jpg" alt="Vim with Syntastic for DrupalCS screenshot." t title="Vim with Syntastic for DrupalCS screenshot." /></a></p>

<p>This environment drastically reduces the number of coding standards issues that
you need to deal with in the review process...ideally down to zero. </p>

<p>Still, there
are going to be times when you need to get some code in shape that is just way
out of compliance. Toward this end, regular expressions can be a huge help as
well. I put together a set of fairly simple expressions to deal with some of the
most eggregious ones, which I use in the form of <a href="https://gist.github.com/1481785">this simple sed
script</a>.  </p>

<p>Full disclosure: this is a pretty clumsy and little tested solution.  Known
issues include the fact that multiline inline comments will wind up with crazy
punctuation and capitalization if sentences span across lines. Fork the Gist and
help out!</p>

<p>Hopefully this will help others get to the place I'm currently at with
Drupal.org coding standards: finding them actually kind of perversely fun.
There's a good feeling knowing that your code is as rigorous as it can get and
will be a seamless part of the beautiful (if GIGANTIC) creation that is the
Drupal universe.</p>

<p>By the way, as of this writing the project application that spawned this post is
still awaiting approval. If you can, please take a moment to head over to
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1369894">http://drupal.org/node/1369894</a> and help move the approval process along it would
be most apprecciated!</p>  </div>

<p>What's a better way to start the new year than taking stock of where we are with the Drupal 8 Multilingual Initiative and where are we going next? If you don't find you way through <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1260534">the maze of the Drupal 8 Multilingual Initiative issues</a>, wondering where to contribute this is your place! If you are actively contributing and need some timely feedback, make sure to be there too. We'll review current issues and shorter term plans to focus on, but we'll probably also touch on longer term todo items (still confined to Drupal 8). The meeting is in the #drupal-i18n channel on IRC. See <a href="http://drupal.org/irc" title="http://drupal.org/irc">http://drupal.org/irc</a> for more information.</p>
<p>(Note time above is marked with UTC - <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20120104T18&amp;p1=50">check in your own timezone</a>).</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>By default, Drupal's core field.module with add 'odd' and 'even' classes to your field items, but it won't add 'first' and 'last' classes! This can quickly be remedied by overriding the core field.tpl.php file with your own custom one.</p>
<p>I'd recommend first copying /modules/field/theme/field.tpl.php into your site's theme folder. For me, the destination was /sites/all/themes/grasmash/templates/field.tpl.php. Then clear your caches. This will force Drupal to check for new template files in your theme's directory, and select the new field.tpl.php as the prioritized template for generating fields.</p>
<p>Here's the business part of my customized field.tpl.php file:</p>
<p>&lt;?php $max_delta = <a href="http://www.php.net/count">count</a>&#40;$items&#41; - 1; ?&gt;
&lt;?php print $classes; ?&gt; clearfix"&lt;?php print $attributes; ?&gt;&gt;
  &lt;?php if &#40;!$label_hidden&#41;: ?&gt;
    &lt;?php print $title_attributes; ?&gt;&gt;&lt;?php print $label ?&gt;:&nbsp;
  &lt;?php endif; ?&gt;
  &lt;?php print $content_attributes; ?&gt;&gt;
    &lt;?php foreach &#40;$items as $delta =&gt; $item&#41;: ?&gt;
      &lt;?php print $delta % 2 ? ' odd' : ' even'; ?&gt;&lt;?php print $delta == 0 ? ' first' : ''; ?&gt;&lt;?php print $delta == $max_delta ? ' last' : ''; ?&gt;"&lt;?php print $item_attributes&#91;$delta&#93;; ?&gt;&gt;&lt;?php print render&#40;$item&#41;; ?&gt;
    &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt;
  
</p>
<p>There are two important changes here:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;?php $max_delta = <a href="http://www.php.net/count">count</a>&#40;$items&#41; - 1; ?&gt; counts the total number of field items in each field, allowing us to determine which field item should be given the 'last' class</li>
<li>&lt;?php print $delta == 0 ? ' first' : ''; ?&gt;&lt;?php print $delta == $max_delta ? ' last' : ''; ?&gt;  will print out our new sparkly classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should note that this may add a small performance tax to your site by requiring PHP to count the $items array for every field, but I think that it is fairly negligible. Some people would prefer not to include this kind of logic in a template file at all. Let me know if you've got a better way!</p>

<p>An early new year&rsquo;s resolution for me is to become more involved in the Drupal community. It&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for months, but Angie &ldquo;webchick&rdquo; Byron&rsquo;s <a href="http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org/sessions/drupal-community-where-are-we-going-and-how-get-involved">keynote at DrupalCamp Austin</a> on November 19 gave me the tangible steps and motivation to jump in. It has been a lot easier to get involved than I anticipated.</p>

Isabell has been a valued member of the Drupal Community and of the Drupal Association for many years and has been an absolute tremendous asset to our community. It will be dificult for us to find another person with the same strength, talent, expertise, personality, and pure awesomeness that Isabell brought to the Association.</p><p><a href="https://association.drupal.org/node/14143" target="_blank">read more</a></p>  </div>
