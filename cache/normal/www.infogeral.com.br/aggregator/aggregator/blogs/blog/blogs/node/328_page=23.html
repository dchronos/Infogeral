    <p>So I'm back in L.A. and gearing up. No better way than to present at a local Drupal User's group.</p>
<p>We look at Features (actually a lot) vs Installation Profiles as everything in code process, which is necessary for the adoption of best practices in development.</p>
<p>Slides: <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dcg2pmwb_109hpc8m8c4" title="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dcg2pmwb_109hpc8m8c4">https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dcg2pmwb_109hpc8m8c4</a></p>

<p>"It seems everyone is talking about using Features for "everything in code" development, but what about installation profiles? This oft-overlooked part of Drupal core is available to us all and provides the tools needed for successful, repeatable development and deployment. Victor Kane is an Drupal developer and trainer with deep roots in the Los Angeles Drupal community. He is the author of Leveraging Drupal: Getting Your Site Done Right. This presentation is a continuation of his articles on the subject at <a href="http://awebfactory.com/node/448" title="http://awebfactory.com/node/448">http://awebfactory.com/node/448</a> and <a href="http://awebfactory.com/node/458" title="http://awebfactory.com/node/458">http://awebfactory.com/node/458</a> "</p>

<img alt="" class="media-image" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/drupal-episerver-sharepoint.jpg" />
I had a very interesting opportunity a few weeks ago: To speak at a customer event of <a href="http://www.meteoriitti.com/">Sininen Meteoriitti</a>, one of the leading companies in <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">Microsoft SharePoint Portal</a> Technology in Finland. I was invited to defend Drupal in a fight where I had very competent opponents defending <a href="http://www.episerver.com/">EPiServer</a> and SharePoint.
 
This fight got started during last summer when I invited <a href="http://twitter.com/perttutolvanen">Perttu Tolvanen</a> from Sininen Meteoriitti to defend SharePoint against Drupal at <a href="http://hel2011.drupaldays.org/">Drupal Business Days in Helsinki</a>. We had a blast in trying to figure out strengths, weaknesses and differences between both products and ecosystems of Drupal and SharePoint. Based on success of this fight management of Sininen Meteoriitti decided (in display of considerable courage) to invite me to speak to at their event for a room full of SharePoint customers. I was naturally delighted on the opportunity to spread the word on why Drupal rocks, so I agreed.
 
To add a bit more challenge EPiServer, a Swedish CMS product that has a huge market share in Sweden and also a smaller presence on the Finnish market, was added to the mix this time. EPiServer was presented by their country manager for Finland, <a href="http://twitter.com/kalle_backman">Kalle Bäckman</a>. If Drupal and SharePoint are both quite similar in many ways EPiServer is really a different beast from both of them. This made the comparison at the same time much more difficult and interesting.
 
The fight itself was very interesting indeed. We had already decided on the criteria we would use to compare the systems on and mostly agreed on strong and weak points of each system before the event. This was the only way we managed to squeeze the fight in a single morning, but it sure didn't stop us from dealing some nice blows during the fight. I especially loved when Perttu was glowing about how SharePoint has such a great support ecosystem and some SharePoint customer from the crowd shouted: "That's only because SharePoint needs such huge amounts of support all the time!"
 
Slides have a lot of detailed information on our comparison, so I'm not going to repeat any of that. To summarize the fight I could just say that Drupal really rocks on complex, integrated web sites. On simpler sites Drupal would have to be used as a packaged product (distribution in Drupal lingo) to compete against simpler CMS systems such as EPiServer. On everything that has to do with online publishing + social Drupal has definitely a very strong position on. When we move to solutions with integrated file management such as knowledge management intranets SharePoint still beats us in most cases. Drupal is a strong competitor on many new fields, but we do have a lot to learn from commercial ecosystems like the one Microsoft runs together with their developers. That being said commercial ecosystems also have a lot to learn from Drupal ecosystem.
 
Based on the feedback we got from the fight audience really loved what they saw. We were also having fun while fighting and did also learn quite a bit when doing the comparisons. There is more to come for sure. Next similar event has actually already been booked for December...
 
* Please note that the slides have been translated from Finnish and some things might have been lost in translation, Perttu and Kalle are by no means responsible for the translated version of the slides

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>We&#8217;ve been working on a website that all of a sudden developed a really specific and annoying problem. After going to any page in the site, the page would load, then would instantly go to a white screen and sit there forever. This only happened to certain users, and was tough to duplicate from any of my dev&nbsp;environments. </p>
<p>Digging deeper, I found that the issue was with the Google Analytics conversion.js script, but only with circa version 3 Firefox and Safari, and it appeared that this issue came up as a result of some change on Google&#8217;s side &#8212; our site used to work fine with these browsers, then something changed and broke.  The &#8220;white&#8221; page was loading a 1px-by-1px tracking pixel from Google, and inexplicably timing out on some request to an Adsense&nbsp;server. </p>
<p>Our site was loading the Adsense conversion tracking script in 3 situations &#8212; general browsing, and based on two specific user-conversion actions. The general browsing instance was handled by the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> module. We added the conversion tracking code in the &#8220;post-snippet code&#8221; to automatically add a reference to Google&#8217;s conversion.js script on every page. For the pre-historic browsers, that spelled a death-knell for the&nbsp;site.</p>

    <p>Page Manager (and family... i.e. Panels) is starting to get some more traction within our community. New users are finding it, using it, and asking awesome questions about it every day. I've done my part both from a development side as well as a teaching front to try to help that along as much as I can, and I'm very pleased with the fact that the community is beginning to find these tools and really appreciate what they can do.  With that being said, I want to pedal some of my own page_manager based wares on those of you who might listen.</p>

<p>Contextual Administration 7.x-1.x RC3 is imminent. For those of you who have not used context_admin or don't know what it is, context_admin is a module that utilizes the power and flexibility of page_manager to locate administrative interfaces at arbitrary urls.  For example, if you have a news article view as /news/view (default tab) then context_admin gives you the ability to add a "Create New News Articles" link at /news/add... or an administrative VBO at /news/admin etc etc. Since these are all page_manager driven pages you have the luxury of specifying who has access to these pages in a much more granular way than the typical 'permissions' system.</p>

<p>There are many great features stuffed into context_admin, including examples of how to prefill node references (ala nodereference_url module, but with a lot more options) and menu auto-population, and taxonomy tree building and much much more. As I said, RC3 is imminent and I just have some access plugins to test at this point.</p>

<p>In addition to all of this, the newest dev of context_admin has a wrapper that exposes all of its administrative plugins to panels to be used within the panels interface. This is a totally experimental feature, but I've been pretty happy with the results thus far. I hope this post helps bring some more converts to the system. Please feel free to track me down in irc or in the issue queue. I'm EclipseGc and spend lots of time in #drupal-contribute as well as other places.</p>

           Project goals: Why, not How
<p>The most important factor when starting a project is to define the goals of the project clearly. A goal doesn't have to be complex, it is often better to try to keep the description of a goal in a few lines of text, pictures or drawings. Project goals should clearly state <strong>why</strong> the project is being done, but ideally should not address the issue of <strong>how</strong> the goals should be reached. If the exact implementation method is fixed in the goal of the project, it can make the actual implementation process immensely more difficult and thus more expensive. Since Drupal, or any other system based on ready-made functionality, offers a huge variety of different possible implementation methods, it is much more sensible to approach the project from the point of view of the goals and leave the studying of more detailed ways of implementation (how) for later.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/u3/goals.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Project goals should be clear enough for entire project team to fully understand and simple enough to be used in project communication to external parties. Based on the project goals we should also be able to set criteria that will be used to measure if project is successful or not.</p>
<p></p>
Requirements
<p>In addition to goals, requirements are always a part of a project. Requirements should be binary, they can be evaluated with simple true/false and it should be clear on how to interpret them. Possible requirements could be, for example, integration of single sign-on registration or the ability to cope with usage spikes of certain amount of requests per second. It is good to divide the requirements into functional and non-functional. Functional requirements are those having a clear effect on the functionality of the system. For example, integrations, functionalities or issues relating to the visual guidelines of the website or service are functional requirements. Non-functional requirements are usually invisible to the end user unless there is a problem with them. These types of requirements are for example response times, backups, ability to do version upgrades and scalability.</p>
<p>When setting requirements, it is important to be exact when they can be considered as done. People also have a tendency to overdo the requirements. Keep in mind that requirements will often be part of the project contract and with a long list of requirements the project will become less and less flexible. Just list the absolutely required things and keep a separate nice to have list instead that will not be part of the contract. Also with requirements it's important to usually concentrate on what should be done and not how to do it.</p>
<p>When defining what should be done preciseness can and shoud be used particularly when it comes to non-functional requirements. In this case it is necessary to use figures instead of vague expressions. For example, the requirement of a system to be able to handle usage spikes of a thousand simultaneous users, is much better than to vaguely require that the system needs to cope also under a lot of traffic.</p>
Realistic scheduling
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/schedule.jpeg" /></p>
<p>When scheduling a project a typical bottleneck is usually found from the client organization. The single most important person in a project is the project owner. The project owner role is the business owner for the project or a proxy of the business owner (customer project manager, product owner in scrum or something similar) in some cases. Project owner is the one who prioritizes work during the project, decides on which alternative implementation paths to take and communicates with the project team daily. Scheduling a project just based on vendor resources is generally a bad idea unless key individuals from the client certainly have enough time for the project.</p>
<p>Project schedule should include enough time for internal beta testing and possible public beta testing. It should be kept in mind that releasing a website or service for the first time to a large audience with large amount of publicity is the most risky way of releasing. Brand new website or service has typically the greatest amount of bugs, issues and things that could have been implemented better in its whole life cycle at the time of release. Together with maximum number of flaws maximum user amounts, equals for a possible catastrophe. By organizing an early limited test release before larger release, the quality can be further improved and the outcome can still be affected based on user experience gathered. In addition to scheduling, it is important to remember to reserve enough budget to analyse the results of the limited test release and to make the necessary changes based on lessons learned.</p>
Budgeting and request for proposals
<p>Depending on the web project, typically 50-95% of the costs of a project for its whole life cycle come after the release. Project life cycle is discussed in more detail in a separate post later. However, budgeting done in the beginning of the project is naturally a critical factor in relation to the success of the project.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/money2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>When creating a project budget most organizations have their own policies. No matter what the basic princibles are every project budget should somehow be based on the expected value generated by the project. This also means that if the size of the investment is starting to cover major part of expected value it's time to reconsider either the scope or if the project should be done at all.</p>
<p>When the project budget is known there are a few different ways to move forward. Usually after goals, requirements, schecule and budget is in place it is time for request for proposals (RFP) from potential suppliers.</p>
<p>Unfortunate in most requests for proposals customer just presents a number of goals and requirements leaving budget open with intention of saving money. This also means proposals by different vendors will be difficult to compare since they differ on scope, quality and price. Even with best RFP different people will always interpret parts of it differently leaving them with different understanding on the scope. Even if we try to lock part of quality with requirements something will most likely be left out and on top of that having a huge list of requirements it not a great thing to start the project with. Pricing is the easiest of these three to compare but it really doesn't tell us that much by itself. Fixed project bids would be easy to compare if scope and quality of offers were identical and daily/hourly rates would be easy to compare if we were comparing interchangeable units. Unfortunately in real life even two fixed bids are never identical in scope and quality and productivity per hour/day is very far from being interchangeable between two knowledge workers.</p>
<p>We are left with a few options: Choose the best proposal based on gut feeling, try to create fancy spreadsheets to compare suppliers on number of criteria or do some combination of these two. In real life this is a difficult process and requires a lot of experience and at least some luck from the buyer.</p>
<p>To make the RFP process even a bit easier it is often a good idea to set the target budget for the project and publish it in the RFP. This approach has multiple good aspects to it. First of all it offers an instant reality check by the potential suppliers where they can right away tell the customer if the budget is realistic or not. Second benefit is that the price really communicates well what sort of scope the customer is expecting for the project. Third and the biggest benefit is that all proposals will be much easier to compare when they compete only with scope and quality and even the variance in scope will be much smaller when the supplier already know the target price. Unfortunately publishing the project budget in RFP is still a rare thing to do, but it makes the process more transparent and has clear benefits to all parties.</p>
<p>Some would say that publishing a budget is bad for price competition between providers. Price competition can be a positive thing, but most complex projects have so many variables that comparing two proposals can be almost impossible. By eliminating the price variable it is possible to get proposals focusing on creating maximum value instead of just minimizing the cost. Hypercompetition can lead to cutting back on quality that will inevitably lead to higher lifetime cost of the project instead of any real sustainable savings.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>Project Applications are the process by which we invite new code contributors to the contributed project repository. This process needs to be made more scalable. In recent weeks the review times have gone down dramatically, but it will be tough to sustain that improvement. I believe solving this problem will require both automation and more humans.* Read through to the end for details on a program where I will mentor anyone interested in learning to do security reviews of a module.</p>
Project application process history
<p>The "project application" process has a relatively long history in the Drupal project. Going back as far as I remember, it was the "cvs application" process where people confirmed they would follow the guidelines for CVS, stated a "motivation" and as long as the motivation was decent they got access. Lots of people applied and then didn't follow the guidelines or never contributed anything. So, it then started to include a sample project so you could show you were legitimately interested and show you were already following some guidelines. This process was all done on a mailing list which meant few people were able to follow and learn from the process. In July or 2009 it was moved to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cvsapplications">CVS Applications</a> project which followed roughly the same process, but was at least in the open where the barriers to entry as a reviewer were lower, the process was more transparent, and anyone could potentially benefit from the feedback in a review. Along the way the requirements of to get approved have changed in a typical organic manner with plenty of discussion, but little unanimous agreement. In addition to security and licensing applications are now reviewed for code style, correctness in use of APIs, duplication of existing projects, quality of documentation. This is a big change from how things were done years ago, but the nature of the Drupal community has also changed a lot in that time.<br />
In March of 2011 we moved to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/projectapplications">Project Application process</a>. The process is roughly:</p>
<ol><li>Go into your profile and check a box agreeing to the terms of use for Drupal's git repository</li>
<li>Create a git sandbox - a new concept introduced by the git migration which has limited review and limited features (no namespace, no downloadable tarball)</li>
<li>Once your sandbox is in a good state, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/add/project-issue/projectapplications">create an issue</a> in the project application queue</li>
<li>Wait, somewhere between a few days and a few months, to get reviewed, fix any problems identified in the review, do some learning about Drupal best practices, and eventually have your project accepted.</li>
</ol><p>The last step - especially the waiting aspect - has caused a lot of concern.</p>
Process inflection point: Drupalcon London
<p>At Drupalcon London, several people interested in the process got together to do some research on the current system, problem analysis, brainstorming on solutions, and gave a <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/coreconversation/1730-1800-project-application-process-revisited">presentation of their ideas to improve the review process</a>. There were two big takeaways:</p>
<ul><li>the current system was taking too long, focusing on the wrong things, frustrating to new contributers</li>
<li>scaling the process with human reviewers is hard, doesn't help with some areas, and we should focus on "automating" as much as possible</li>
</ul><p>"Automating" takes on two meanings here. First, automate some truly automatable tasks like looking for files named LICENSE* or identifying the lack of a README.txt and alerting the user to fix those problems with links to documentation. This frees up human reviewers and is emotionally easier for the applicant to get that feedback from a robot. Second, it also means we could create a "quiz" which would help automate some of the API and security checks people do while also providing more consistent coverage of areas of Drupal. Regarding coverage, consider a typical Drupal module which might touch on 2 elements of security but miss 20. The quiz can help to cover all 20 items.<br />
Work is underway on automating these things in a step-by-step manner. We'll add some, see how it works, and consider adding more as we can. If it's taken to its conclusion this will require improvements to the <a href="http://qa.drupal.org/">testing infrastructure</a>, and automated code review tools like <a href="http://drupal.org/project/coder">coder</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/secure_code_review">secure code review</a> among others.<br />
Two big posts that you should refer to if interested in how to automate the process are <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/180444">the Jthorson battle plan</a> which draws heavily on the Drupalcon London presentation for ideas. A somewhat related post is <a href="http://blog.boombatower.com/breathing-new-life-into-the-testbot">Jim Berry's ReviewDriven.com based proposal</a> to revamp the testing.<br />
Meanwhile back at the ranch...</p>
Manual Drupal project reviews continue
<p>2 months after Drupalcon London, the manual review process has to continue. For most of that time it stayed roughly the same: applications that needed review hovered in the 200+ range and projects took between 1 week and as long as 8 weeks to get a review.<br />
However, in the last 2 weeks it has gotten a lot better. It's hard to say exactly why, but <a href="http://drupal.org/user/262198">Klaus Purer</a> of <a href="http://epiqo.com/">epiqo</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/109890">Scott Reynen</a> of <a href="http://atendesigngroup.com/">Aten Design Group</a> have both done an amazing number of reviews (I've done a fair number as well ;) ). Just take a look at this graph showing the "needs review" queue falling while we see a rise in the lines for the  needs work and "all fixed" (a combination of fixed and closed fixed). The needs work queue dropped as low as 24, though it's back up a bit. After the initial cleanup we're getting to a point where the "needs work" queue is starting to fall and the "all fixed" is starting to rise. </p>
How you can help!
<p>So, now we get to the good stuff.<br />
If you want to get involved we need help in a variety of places.<br />
You can join the irc room for #drupal-codereview or view resources in the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/code-review">Code Review group</a>, both of which will help you get plugged in to all the initiatives I described above. If you want to do reviews, you should especially read the resources in the "Go Ahead and Review" area on the group homepage. If you want to help with automation, see <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/184414">this wiki of tasks to automate</a>.<br />
Here is what I think is a somewhat important part: For folks who will do manual reviews, I am making an offer: you do the first step in the review looking for items in the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/894256">how to review</a> section and I'll do one-on-one mentoring through the security review. More on that idea in a blog post tomorrow.</p>
*Important side note
<p>There is also a vocal contingent that thinks the solution is to open the flood-gates. If we let anyone create a project with their own namespace and full tarball downloads then that would remove the whole need to build this crazy bureaucracy/automation stuff. The drawbacks there are namespace squatting, the problem of module duplication leading to confusion about which module to use, and that it would likely lead to large (or just larger?) numbers of insecure modules. Those problems can probably all be solved in other ways and its important to note the plan I'm working toward is not the only way to "solve" this problem.</p>

    <p><em>This is partially a continuation of yesterday's post on <a href="/blog/growing-drupals-contributors-project-applications">Growing Drupal contributors and the project application process</a>.</em></p>
<p>Over the next 2 months there are at least <strong>five</strong> great ways you can learn about security in Drupal.</p>
Mentoring for project application reviewers
<p>If you do a project application review (<a href="/blog/growing-drupals-contributors-project-applications">learn what/why</a>) I will gladly mentor you in how to do the security review portion of that review. There are a few things I tend to look for, and I'm not perfect in what I do, but the more people who learn how to do it the better. I think a one-on-one mentoring would be really helpful in this regard to give people the confidence to look for security issues themselves. It would be helpful if you have already read <a href="http://drupal.org/writing-secure-code">writing secure code</a> in the Drupal handbook and/or <a href="http://crackingdrupal.com/">my book on security</a>. So, this counts as two ways: free mentoring and links to free documentation and a paid book ;)</p>
<p>In my role as Directory of Security Services at Acquia I've had some time in the last weeks to do a lot of reviews on new modules (focused on security). However in the next weeks I have a pretty busy schedule so I'm looking to expand the pool of folks who are knowledgable enough and willing to do these security reviews.</p>
<p>Obviously I have to balance this program with normal work, but I am dedicated to up to one person per day. So, if you are interested in this let's follow <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/184709">the process I laid out on groups.drupal.org</a>.</p>
BADcamp Sessions
<p>This past weekend was <a href="http://2011.badcamp.net/&#039;&gt;BADcamp&lt;/a&gt; in Berkeley, California. We had back to back security sessions. I presented &lt;a href=">review of how Drupal Security compares</a> and fellow Drupal Security Team member <a href="http://drupal.org/user/143172">Matt Chapman</a> delivered <a href="http://2011.badcamp.net/program/sessions/keeping-your-drupal-site-secure-working-drupal-security-team">keeping your site secure</a>. The BADCamp folks recorded all the sessions and will be posting videos in the coming weeks.</p>
Webinar on security: Tuesday the 25th
<p>On October 25th at 1PM New York Time I will be giving a webinar about security. It will be a quick review of some important topics:</p>
<ul><li>General security theory</li>
<li>Comparison of Drupal to other CMS options</li>
<li>How to identify common mistakes with the Security Review Module</li>
<li>Benefits of a security audit</li>
</ul><p>I'll be sharing best practices for protecting your Drupal site against common security attacks.  This session will include a discussion of some of the most common vulnerabilities he's discovered when auditing sites and the best tools to overcome them.</p>
Drupal Training at Drupalcamp Austin
<p>The amazing folks in Austin are putting on <a href="http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org/">Drupalcamp Austin</a> again this year and they've decided to add a training component integrated into the camp days. So, on Saturday November 19th from 8:45 to 12:15 I will be delivering an in-depth "let's look at code" <a href="http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org/training/introduction-drupal-security-coders">Security Training</a>.</p>
<p>And no doubt there will also be some security sessions at Drupalcamp Austin.</p>

    <p>As a new member of the Acquia Design team, it’s an honor to be working with smart and dedicated UX designers. I’ve been focusing on usability studies, and I’m a little bit like a kid in a usability candy shop, with all the <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/conference/sessions/creating-and-measuring-user-experience">usability evaluation tools</a> available to us. Usability studies are essential to the Acquia engineering process; our goal is to build the most useful, efficient and usable features for our customers, so we need to speak with real people who use Drupal. We conduct most of our usability studies using screensharing or self-moderated tools, but I’m excited to announce that will be doing some upcoming studies in person.</p>
Usability studies at BADCamp
<p><a href="/about-us/team/dharmesh-mistry">Dharmesh Mistry</a> and I will be at <a href="http://2011.badcamp.net">BADCamp</a> (21-23 October 2011; 1400+ attendees!) to conduct quick usability studies with attendees who are interested. </p>
<p>We will be focusing on three studies, two for Acquia and one for the Drupal community. Each will be 15 minutes or less of your time. We’ll confirm our exact location at the camp in a comment below, and by Twitter (we are @dcmistry and @lisarex). You don’t need to bring anything; just show up!</p>
<p><a href="https://skitch.com/lisarex/gn8un/preview"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111020-jw5nqrp7ad7ar76anr6sr3139t.preview.png" alt="Preview" /></a></p>
$15 for 15 minutes of your time
<p>We’d like feedback in person from Drupalists. Get a $15 iTunes card for your participation in one of these studies:</p>
<ul><li>For anyone interested in building social communities, such as an intranet, help us with the Acquia Commons landing page review</li>
<li>For Drupal developers, help us with a new product in the Acquia Network</li>
</ul>Drupal contributor survey, for the community
<p>Several established Drupal community members want to find out what new and established contributors need, what barriers prevent contributions, and overall opinions of the Drupal community in general. Dharmesh and I are part of the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/usability">Drupal UX team</a>, and are helping out by conducting this survey. We will be talking with people one-on-one initially. Each interview should last about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Your participation in this survey is an excellent contribution to the community. The results of the new contributor survey will be used to inform decisions on <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1289748">updating the Community, Support and Getting Involved landing pages</a> on Drupal.org, as well as other active Drupal.org improvements, such as improved community initiative pages. I’ll also be using results in my upcoming session, <a href="http://drupalcampnh.org/sessions/contribute-drupal-community-without-writing-line-code">Contribute to the Drupal community without writing a line of code</a>.</p>
<p>The following weekend, we will both be at DrupalCamp NH, and can continue our studies there.</p>
<p>Hope to meet you at one of the events! And by the way, we look like this:</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>Yet another key component to the Drupal Platform is the install profile and it's another one that deserves a few posts to cover it adequately. The goal of this series of posts will be to build an install profile capable of creating a basic brochure-style website - more or less what <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>'s core functionality offers (ok, we'll be doing a bit less for this example ;-)).</p>
<p>Drupal 7 install profiles differ quite significantly from Drupal 6 install profiles so a lot of the material covered here won't necessarily apply if you're working on D6 only. There's already a lot of great documentation to help get you started. Drupal.org has an <a href="http://drupal.org/node/159730">overview of install profiles</a> that's worth taking a read through, for example. The Drupal documentation also covers all of the common hooks that you may want to use in your profile. But the best place, without question, is just reading through the Drupal core profile code (no, I'm not joking). Check out profiles/minimal, and profiles/standard folders that come with Drupal, particularly the .info, .profile, and the .install files.</p>
<p>To be upfront about things here, I've personally never built an install profile in Drupal 7 so this is a bit of a learning experience for me as well. I know that a lot of the limitations that existed in Drupal 6 have been solved so hopefully the process will be smoother. As always, if you notice anything I've done wrong or could do better please leave a comment as I want to promote best practices for building platforms.</p>
<p>There are a few differences between an installation profile that you'll run manually as you install Drupal (an option that would sit next to minimal or standard in the Drupal install process) versus an install profile to be used for automatically creating sites through Aegir. The primary difference is that an install profile to be used in Aegir should have no options that the user needs to fill out or answer. Defaults are important here. Any kind of setup that the user must do will need to be done after the site it created, not before, possibly with some sort of configuration wizard for this which I'll hopefully write more on later.</p>
<p>For this post I'm only going to run through a typical install profile as opposed to an Aegir-specific one which I'll write on later (and conveniently, can be much simpler than a standard profile).</p>
Anatomy of an install profile:
<p>The initial setup for the install profile is quite trivial. All you need to do is create the folder and the files, and then list out the modules you wish to be enabled on site creation. Basically a combination of creating a new site in a multisite setup and creating a module.</p>
<p>Start with this folder structure in your D7 site:</p>

profiles/brochure
profiles/brochure/brochure.info
profiles/brochure/brochure.install
profiles/brochure/brochure.profile 
profiles/brochure/modules
profiles/brochure/modules/contrib
profiles/brochure/modules/custom
profiles/brochure/modules/features
profiles/brochure/themes
<p>
All the non-core modules used on your site will now go into the installation profiles' folder as opposed to sites/all. This isn't required, but will make your install profile more complete and is a good way to keep things organized.</p>
.info
<p>Unlike in D6 install profiles, you define the modules you want to install with your profile in the .info file as a dependency, just as you would with a standard drupal module. This makes install profiles much more consistent with how the rest of drupal packages work, and more importantly, makes our life easier.</p>
.profile
<p>The .profile file is equivalent to the .module file in a module or template.php in a theme. This is where you'll define any hooks required for your profile. Unlike Drupal 6, install profiles in Drupal 7 now have the privilege of running under a fully bootstrapped Drupal. This is a huge benefit, and makes the life of an install profile in D7 much more enjoyable than those poor D6 profiles.</p>
.install
<p>The tough part comes in the .install file. Take a look at the profiles/standard/standard.install file. It starts by defining and creating filter formats and then blocks. It also includes the creation of content types, fields, rdf mappings, roles, and menus.</p>
<p>The good news is that a huge percentage of this, the heavy lifting, can be removed by the use of features. For example, we don't need to create content types, fields, roles, menus, etc. by hand as they're all defined and created by the features we use on our site (see <a href="http://scotthadfield.ca/2011/09/19/simple-feature">A simple feature</a> for reference).</p>
<p>The bad news is that for more complex profiles you <em>will</em> need to get into the nitty gritty of the Drupal API. In some cases the install profile api (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/install_profile_api" title="http://drupal.org/project/install_profile_api">http://drupal.org/project/install_profile_api</a>) can simplify things for you (at the time of writing there is not yet a D7 version), but for most things you should look at <a href="http://drupal.org/project/installation+profiles">other install profiles</a> for examples.</p>
<p>In my next post I'll demonstrate creating the skeleton of a basic profile based off of the Drupal minimal and standard profiles as well as a little pinch of our own special sauce.</p>  </div>

I've been asked to facilitate a code sprint at <a href="http://drupalcampdelhi.com/">Drupal Camp Delhi</a> in a couple weeks.  I've never led a code sprint before, but I have participated in several.  I'm thrilled to do it, but then there are a lot of logistical questions that are rasied.  What format it should take? Who and how many should attend?  Will there be beer?  These are serious questions that I don't have clear answers to.  I thought about it and decided to describe the different formats I've witnessed.
General "grab an issue" sprint.
People show up and work on what they are interested in already.  They collaborate and ask each other questions, but generally just keep it informal and working groups form organically.
<ul><li>Preparation: Low</li>
<li>Easy to get involved: Yes, but tough for complete newbies unless there is prep.</li>
<li>Tangible results: Low</li>
<li>Group size: Any</li>
</ul>Organized "grab an issue" sprint
A facilitator picks a bunch of issues ahead of time, organizes them (perhaps by experience level or skill type) and then doles them out to people who want to work on them.  People can work in pairs, or individually, but the end result is some amount of traction on a particular topic (piece of core, module, documentation, etc).  <a href="http://webchick.net">Angie Byron</a> added to this a variation: <em>"we've done a cool thing before in Montreal where we divided a room up into stations: the translation table, the testing table, the design table, etc. They start with an overview of what there is to work on, then a specific set of issues. Then, in periodic (hour-long, half-day, whatever) time chunks, rotate 'stations' so you get to learn how to contribute to multiple facets of Drupal."</em>
<ul><li>Preparation: Medium</li>
<li>Easy to get involved: Yes because it is focused but the person shouldn't have to be an expert.</li>
<li>Tangible results: Medium</li>
<li>Group size: max 20 or so</li>
</ul>Dedicated project w/ goals sprint
In this model, usually a group will take a module, pick a few objectives, plan out issues ahead of time and coordinate with a group who can hit the ground running.  Then the group will split up into pairs, work on issues and pass them off to the rest of the group for review and committal.  This format is usually punctuated with architectural discoveries and discussions which is great because many knowledgable people are in the room.
<ul><li>Preparation: High</li>
<li>Easy to get involved: No, people need to come with expertise.</li>
<li>Tangible results: High</li>
<li>Group size: small, maybe 8 people max for effective decision making</li>
</ul><p>Do you have other formats which worked well?  Why and in what scenarios?</p>
<p> </p>

Sketch Books

<p>Because Aten Design Group is a proud sponsor BADCamp, the kind folks organizing the Camp offered us a table of some sort from which to hawk our wares.  This means a bunch of awesome free stuff: stickers, pins and – most importantly – sketchbooks.  We'll be bringing along the books we made this summer for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atendesigngroup/6262158240/in/photostream/">DrupalCon London</a>.  So if you missed getting a book from me at DC London, or you've already filled yours up with notes and sketches and such, come by our table and get your own book while they last.</p>

<p>We'll be posting important BADCamp happenings on Twitter all weekend long, so keep an eye on the old <a href="http://twitter.com/atendesign">@atendesign</a> account.</p>

                    <a href="/blog/express-checkout-drupal-commerce"><img src="http://atendesigngroup.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/expressCheckout.png" alt="" /></a>            
                    <p>Drupal <a href="http://http://drupal.org/project/commerce">Commerce</a> is a robust, flexible e-commerce platform. Wading through its several pages of configuration options isn't always easy, though. That's why we've put together a cheat-sheet for configuring a clean, simple express checkout with Drupal Commerce.</p>

<p>What is express checkout? For the sake of this post, we'll call it a single page checkout process that any user - including an anonymous user - can complete in a snap. We'll also assume that you want your users to proceed to checkout the moment they click a <em>Buy now</em> button, instead of having to first proceed to a shopping cart page.</p>

<p>An express checkout can un-clutter your website's online shopping experience and keep your users happy. It's also very easy to set up — we'll do it in five steps and about ten or fifteen minutes. Before we get started, make sure you've installed commerce and configured your first products. After that, you're ready to go.</p>

Create a rule to redirect users to checkout

<p>First we'll add a system rule to redirect users to the checkout page after they click the <em>Add to Cart</em> button. On to the redirect:</p>

<ol>
<li>From http://www.example.com/admin, click on the <em>Configuration</em> link, then <em>Rules</em>, then <em>Add a new rule</em></li>
<li>Enter <em>Redirect to checkout on add to cart</em> as the rule's name</li>
<li>Select <em>After adding a product to the cart</em> from the <em>React on event</em> dropdown, then click <em>Save</em></li>
<li>Under the <em>Actions</em> section, click <em>Add action</em></li>
<li>Under the <em>Select the action to add</em> dropdown, select <em>Page redirect</em></li>
<li>Type <em>checkout</em> in the <em>Value</em> dialogue, then click <em>Save</em></li>
<li>Click <em>Save Changes</em></li>
</ol>

<p>There! Now your users will go directly to checkout instead of hassling with the pesky shopping cart page.</p>

Shift your checkout panes out of <em>review order</em>

<p>Commerce separates different portions of the checkout process onto separate pages. For large, complicated orders, this makes a lot of sense. For a simple order, though, it just  means more clicks and skim-reading before your users' orders are complete. Getting rid of the multi-page process is a cinch:</p>

<ol>
<li>From http://www.example.com/admin, click on the <em>Store</em> link, then <em>Configuration</em>, then <em>Checkout settings</em></li>
<li>Drag the <em>Review</em> item out of the <em>Review order</em> section and down into the <em>Disabled</em> section</li>
<li>Drag the <em>Payment</em> item out of the <em>Review order</em> section and up into the <em>Checkout</em> section</li>
<li>Click <em>Save Configuration</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Presto! Emptying the <em>Review order</em> section of the checkout process is the gist of a single page checkout.</p>

Grant anonymous users the <em>Access checkout</em> permission

<p>By default anonymous users aren't permitted to complete the checkout process. Changing this is almost as easily done as said:</p>

<ol>
<li>From http://www.example.com/admin, click on the <em>People</em> link, then <em>Permissions</em></li>
<li>Under the <em>Checkout</em> section, grant the <em>Access checkout</em> permission to anonymous users</li>
<li>Click <em>Save Permissions</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Voila! Now your anonymous users can shop to their hearts' content.</p>

Set your users' expectations with a custom order complete page

<p>Drupal Commerce creates a user account on the fly when an anonymous user checks out. It can't, however, log them in after account creation. This means that the user will need to activate their account in order to view their order or receipt information. It might be smart to create an order completion page for anonymous users wherein you let them know about these fairly important details. Once you've created a custom order completion page for your anonymous shoppers, you can use rules to make sure they see it:</p>

<ol>
<li>From http://www.example.com/admin, click on the <em>Configuration</em> link, then <em>Rules</em>, then <em>Add a new rule</em></li>
<li>Enter <em>Redirect to anonymous order completion</em> as the rule's name</li>
<li>Select <em>Completing the checkout process</em> from the <em>React on event</em> dropdown, then click <em>Save</em></li>
<li>Under the <em>Conditions</em> section, click <em>Add condition</em></li>
<li>Select <em>User has role(s)</em> from the <em>Select the condition to add</em> dropdown</li>
<li>Type <em>site:current-user</em> in the <em>Data Selector</em> dialogue</li>
<li>Select <em>authenticated user</em> from the <em>Value</em> options under <em>Role</em></li>
<li>Check <em>Negate</em> near the bottom of the page, then click <em>Save</em></li>
<li>Under the <em>Select the action to add</em> dropdown, select <em>Page redirect</em></li>
<li>Type the path of your custom order completion page in the <em>Value</em> dialogue, then click <em>Save</em></li>
<li>Click <em>Save Changes</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Listo! Your custom order completion page will make sure your anonymous users don't feel deserted after their payment has gone through.</p>

Change your button text to make better sense

<p>You'll want to use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/stringoverrides">String Overrides</a> module to change the <em>Add to Cart</em> text used on product pages to <em>Buy now</em>, and the <em>Continue to next step</em> text on the checkout page to <em>Express Checkout</em>. String Overrides is pretty simple to use, so we'll forego a walk through for this portion.</p>

And a note about your shopping cart…

<p>You may notice that the cart displayed on your checkout page isn't editable. Depending on what type of buying process you're trying to build, you may want to change that. You can remove the cart from the checkout page altogether by simply dragging it into the <em>Disabled</em> section under Commerce's <em>Checkout settings</em>. You can also replace it with an editable cart by first dragging it into the <em>Disabled</em> section, and then displaying the <em>Shopping Cart</em> block on the checkout page. You can do that last bit using Drupal's standard block management interface at <em>admin/structure/block</em>.</p>

    <p>On 7 &amp; 8 November I'll be attending <a href="http://www.infomanagementcenter.com/DITAeurope/2011/index.htm">DITA Europe in Prague</a>. At the conference I'll be giving a talk on <a href="http://www.infomanagementcenter.com/DITAeurope/2011/abstracts.htm#tomme">Strategies to Implement an Enterprise Social Platform with DITA Content</a>.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 8th I'll be doing a try-out of the talk I submitted for Drupalcon Denver: <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/what-we-can-learn-single-sourcing-multi-device-world">What we can learn from single sourcing in a multi-device world</a> at a local Drupal User Group.</p>
<p>And last but not least we are organizing a Drupal-DITA code sprint as part of the <a href="http://opendita.drupalgardens.com/">first openDITA code sprint</a> on the 9th of November. If you are interested in documentation in Drupal, want to work with the enterprise standard for technical documentation, want to do stuff with Drupal and DITA or live not far from Prague and want to be part of a cool codesprint, you should definitely <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/pronovix.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHNwYlNlczFNb2FUYXZkcjM5Rm90NFE6MQ">fill in the registration form</a> and come over.</p>  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>There's only a certain amount of bandwidth in a person's day. As you get older, that bandwidth seems to become more and more constrained.&nbsp; Kids are extreme bandwidth hogs :)&nbsp; Over the years I've found that I have enough bandwidth in my life to deal with one obsession that's not part of my day job at any given time.&nbsp; For the last couple years, that obsession has been with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> and specifically with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery">Node Gallery</a>.&nbsp; In my very biased opinion, it's the most user-friendly and integrated gallery experience you can have with Drupal 6.x.&nbsp; Also IMHO, there's a huge void in Drupal 7 with respect to butt-kicking gallery modules, one that's begging to be filled with a Node Gallery 7.x branch.</p>
<p>But I just can't bring myself to that one simple git command.&nbsp; I've had several changes at work in the past year, and I'm no longer working with Drupal and PHP on a regular basis.&nbsp; I've become enthralled with Puppet as of late, and that's proven to be the gateway drug to the devops movement for me.&nbsp; I'm reading books on Kanban, learning a bit of Ruby, building deployment pipelines, and soaking up anything I can on devops.&nbsp; It seems sysadmins who can code really do have a place in the world, and it appears to be in devops.</p>
<p>It's not burnout, it's simply a matter of prioritization on demands for a limited resource.&nbsp; There's just no time left over for Drupal anymore.</p>
<p>Back to the point of this post -- Node Gallery needs a co-maintainer who can take the module into the 7.x branch.&nbsp; The recently released 6.x-3.x branch has proven to be quite stable, and would likely require only very minimal maintenance.&nbsp; You can take it for a spin on the <a href="http://ng3demo.sysadminsjourney.com">demo site</a>, or read all about it's features on the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery">project page</a>.&nbsp; Here's some quick points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a reported user base of just under 3,800 sites, which puts it at right around #400 on the top modules list.</li>
<li>It has a great user base that's proven to be active in the issue queue.&nbsp; Many of the support requests have been resolved by members of the community whom have never written a line of code.&nbsp; It has a strong German presence, and has been translated.</li>
<li>It integrates very tightly with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a>, and supports bulk uploading with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/plupload">Plupload</a>.&nbsp; It has it's own access module in <a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery_access">Node Gallery Access</a>, as well as a handful of other modules (all of which are listed on the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery">project page</a>) it integrates with very well.</li>
<li>It's been engineered to perform well from the start.&nbsp; If your server can handle the load of 100,000 nodes, there's no reason it should be able to handle 100,000 Node Gallery image nodes -- even if those are all in one gallery.</li>
<li>The administration UI aims to provide a working gallery setup out-of-the-box that works for 90% of the users, yet provide enough buttons and knobs for the remaining 10% to be able to tweak what they need.</li>
<li>It runs the gamut of technologies in Drupal; making use of caching, Views integration, jQuery and jQuery UI, CCK, Node Access, Batch API, etc.</li>
<li>What differentiates Node Gallery from most other gallery modules is that each and every image in a gallery isn't just a field, it's an entire node.&nbsp; This opens up huge possibilities for interactions with other contrib modules.&nbsp; The original reason for me selecting Node Gallery was because it was the only way I could sell individual images using Ubercart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who I'm looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>This module is likely a bit complex for someone who's never maintained a module before.&nbsp; If you've maintained your own Drupal module (either privately or on d.o), take a look at the code and make sure you can understand what's going on.</li>
<li>Drupal 7 API experience is a must; experience in migrating D6 modules to D7 is a plus.</li>
<li>Ideally, you need to have an "itch that needs scratching" -- in other words, you should probably have a need for an image gallery.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like to take a crack at bringing Node Gallery to Drupal 7, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/99149/contact">contact me</a>, or <a href="http://drupal.org/node/add/project-issue/node_gallery">file an issue</a> in the issue queue.</p>
