    <p>The problem:<br />
When clicking "add more values" to add another field to a cck multi-value field, and if you're using ckeditor, the existing multi-value fields will disappear.</p>
<p>So, if you have cck multi-field, and must use ckeditor, here are 3 useful things to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Detach the ckeditor instances before attaching them again:<br />

          <p>Companies don't do projects - people do projects. It is essential to keep this in mind when selecting a supplier. Even though a particular company has done exceptional projects in the past, the future success has ultimately to do with the competence of individuals taking part in the project. Companies can create the culture, process and also have the support in place for greatly enhancing the possibility to do successful projects but still the actual results depend on the individuals actually involved.</p>
<p>I have experience in both being a customer and service provider for software services from over 15 years. In this post I will do my best to summarize some of the things I've learned about how to choose a service provider. I'm however not trying to write a comprehensive guide on choosing a software service provider in general but one that applies especially to Drupal services. Some parts of the post are generic but most of it are very much related to Drupal and the current Drupal market.</p>
Specialities of Open Source
<p>Open source has made it easier to evaluate providers and developers. Previously the providers could have said they have done projects X, Y and Z and at the same time inform that the characteristics and details of the projects are classified. Within the open source community, participation with the product itself is public. This is especially true with projects like Drupal where everything rotates around the central Drupal.org site. It is easy to go and see what a developer has been working on, evaluate the code and see how long history a developer has.</p>
<p>Some companies will still claim that their developers are really experienced even when Drupal.org profiles of their developers are almost empty. Customer projects are after all often under non-disclosure agreement and details on what individual developers have done in them are not public. If a developer has not participated in the open source community or has not produced anything visible within it, it is completely reasonable to question their competence. In order to know an open source product you must take part in the community. There is no other way to influence or even know where a product is going, get support and get issues fixed. There are also a number of business benefits for a customer if their development team contributes back to the community. It takes a while to explain why contributing back to the community is a great idea for a customer and it will be a topic of another blog post.</p>
<p>When evaluating the competence of a particular team member, more traditional ways like evaluating developer CVs and client references should always be accompanied with having a look at their Drupal.org profiles. These profiles show immediately the amount of participation a particular developer has had in the community, the duration of their involvement and the depth of their knowledge.</p>
Business competence
<p>In addition to evaluating technical and Drupal competence, it is essential to evaluate the competence of the team in regards to the business vertical of the project. Previous experience in projects within the similar business vertical is important, as this helps the team to understand customer requirements and build new ideas on top of them. Not everybody on the project team has to be expert and teams with mixed experience may often even produce better results than teams that have plenty of experience in a single business vertical.</p>
Cultural fit and communication competence
<p>Another important aspect is cultural compatibility of developers. A good developer should be able to relate to users of a site. For example if you are building an e-commerce site you should be able to relate to how customers will use the site. Thinking like this is difficult if a developer is from a very different culture than the users of the site and it means a developer will just do exactly what he is being told to do without adding any value to the project. Developers that just blindly implement without thinking are not very valuable and they put a huge pressure on documenting every little detail on the customer. Even the most comprehensive documentation can't cover every interaction so the result of the documentation driven process is almost always worse than a more agile one.</p>
<p>Because of the stereotypes within a technical field, also the social competence of the team members should be considered when selecting the team. Developers are often too focused on the technical details leaving other factors secondary. If the communication between developers and the rest of the organization does not go smoothly, the outcome is either suboptimal or at least there is a lot of extra work required from everybody in the project. It also makes work frustrating for everyone involved if communication is an obstacle in daily work. For these reasons, fluent communication skills are really a must-have for any developer.</p>
Providers of different size
<p>Competent providers are found in every size from freelancers to mega corporations with tens of thousands of employees. Mostly same things apply to providers of all sizes, but there are some special characteristics.</p>
<p>In terms of commitment and price, it is often best to use freelancers with no fixed expenses and thus more flexible pricing for small projects. This also makes sure that a particular person is hired for the job and that they are committed to the project. Vacations or other days off at a wrong time are usually not generally an issue with a freelancer - they only get paid when they are working after all. Unfortunately, good freelancers are often hard to find. Another down side is that using only freelancers doesn't scale well for bigger projects and in many cases customers want to have an organization that can be held responsible on project results. In large projects, maintenance can also be an issue since it's not realistic to ask for 24/7 support from freelancers, not even when some of them are more than willing to sell it.</p>
<p>Micro companies with less than ten employees are mostly in the same category as freelancers. Same strengths and weaknesses apply, but naturally they can take on bigger projects than individual freelancers.</p>
<p>Small and medium companies are often technically the most capable ones when it comes to using open source technology. This is certainly true with Drupal. Most companies of this size have between ten and a hundred employees. With more resources, these companies can often take on a project of almost any size on their own. On many markets these companies seem to face a fierce price competition from smaller players with limited fixed costs. This hypercompetition might end up pushing daily rates down even to an unsustainable levels. Small and medium companies usually have limited financial resources and if they become unprofitable they will quickly have to let people go. Letting people go can wreck a company on highly competitive job market with competent people leaving the company. For this reason it is certainly a risk to work with small or medium company that is not clearly profitable. Other than the financial risk most of the best companies currently on the Drupal market are of a small and medium size.</p>
<p>Large IT companies have also been moving to Drupal lately. They are good at selling to large public and private projects with their sales teams and vast experience in large projects. The biggest difference when working with large IT is that teams become even more important. A large IT company might include references from other side of the world and initial team members who change positions in the middle of a project. It is even more important to evaluate the team, not the company with large IT. Currently many large IT companies also lack experience in Drupal and tend to outsource the work to smaller companies. This might change in the future, but at least currently not many large IT companies have considerable knowledge in working with Drupal.</p>
<p>The size of the provider is not by no means a determining factor in provider selection. At least not as long as the different characteristics of the different size classes are considered.</p>

<p>After some discussion with Angie, who had discussed it with catch, we've decided to move all open issues for WSCCI to the core issue queue. Hopefully that should help get the effort more exposure.</p>
<p>The code is <em>not</em> moving.  The sandbox is still the definitive source for the latest WSCCI code.</p>
<p>There is a new component in the core queue, "wscci".  Any issues filed there should be made against the sandbox code as before, but will show up in the core queue.  If you want to see just wscci-related issues, see (or bookmark) <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?component%5B%5D=wscci">this search query</a>.</p>
<p>If reviewing a patch in that component, understand that it is made against the "wscci" branch of the WSCCI sandbox, not core.  Also, for that reason, testbot <em>will not work</em> for those issues, and would mark anything needs-work automatically.  If you're posting a patch, please name it with a -D8 suffix so that the testbot ignores it.</p>
<p>The "wscci" issue tag should still be used for general core issues in other components that are directly relevant to the WSCCI initiative.</p>
<p>We'll see if this works out.  If it ends up being too confusing, we'll try something else. :-)</p>

<p>There's a budding <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/191163">discussion</a> in the WSCCI and Services groups about a Drupal-wide consistent standard for how to respond to REST requests.  (When should use we a 403 vs. 404 vs. 406 vs. returning a 200 with a 0 as the only value, etc.)  Right now Services.module-related code is very inconsistent.  That should be made consistent both for Services and for Drupal 8 with the WSCCI initiative.  What should that standard be?  Discuss. :-)</p>

<p>You’ll hear the words “MVP” thrown around a lot in the update this week. It stands for “Minimum Viable Product”, and it’s a way for us to define what “success” means for each initiative. More to come on this later :)</p>
<p>Also, our next meeting isn’t until Dec 8th, so you won’t see an update over the Thanksgiving holidays because a bunch of us are enjoying turkey.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    Introduction
<p> The <a href="http://www.weforum.org/">World Economic Forum</a> (the Forum) runs WELCOM, their internal collaboration platform on Drupal. The Forum is an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders. It is best known for its annual conference in Davos, Switzerland. These world leaders use WELCOM during and after the conference to work on major issues such as climate change, world health, poverty, etc. It is vitally important for our planet that WELCOM serves its users well.</p>
Before Drupal
<p> WELCOM has been around for quite a while. When the <a href="/products-services/acquia-professional-services/service-offerings">Acquia Migration team</a> arrived, WELCOM was an impressive mashup of Flash, JBoss, LDAP, custom web services in C#, Sharepoint Web Services, MS Exchange, and MS SQL Server. Acquia decided early on to focus on the MS SQL Server layer and migrate data directly from there. Acquia employed one of its favorite open source weapons, the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/migrate">migrate module</a>. Having already developed <a href="/resources/acquia-tv/conference/peek-behind-scenes-how-clarity-media-moving-examinercom-drupal-7">a source plugin for MS SQL Server on the Examiner.com project</a>, Acquia was off and running.</p>
Drupal Commons
<p> WELCOM is a full featured social networking application. Users have profile fields with granular privacy control. Users may join groups and post public or private content into those groups. Groups have wikis, documents, discussions, events, etc. Users have mutually confirmed friend relationships. Users have activity streams (aka news feed). To fulfill all these needs in Drupal, the Forum turned to <a href="http://commons.acquia.com/">Drupal Commons</a>.</p>
Building the Migrations
<p>An early development task is to break up the project into several distinct <em>migrations</em></p>
<p>A migration represents a flow from one set of source data (typically the output of a database query) to a Drupal content type. Destinations can include nodes, taxonomy terms, users, profiles, comments, or private messages. Here are some migrations at the Forum:</p>
<ul><li>Users
</li><li>Discussions
</li><li>Documents
</li><li>Profiles
</li><li>User relationships (friends)
</li><li>Friend requests, with audit trail
</li><li>Communities and memberships (organic groups)
   </li></ul>Write Migration code
<p> The heart of a migration class is to specify a SQL query or other method of fetching the source data and also define mappings between source columns and Drupal properties such as $node-&gt;status, $user-&gt;mail, $comment-&gt;subject, etc. Here is the user migration:</p>
class UserWelcomMigration extends WelcomMigration {<br /> public function __construct() {<br />   parent::__construct();<br />   // Source system has username is unique id.<br />   $this-&gt;map = new MigrateSQLMap($this-&gt;machineName,<br />       array('Username' =&gt; array(<br />               'type' =&gt; 'varchar',<br />               'length' =&gt; 50,<br />               'not null' =&gt; TRUE,<br />               )<br />            ),<br />       MigrateDestinationUser::getKeySchema()<br />   );<br />   $query = 'SELECT p.Username, p.EmailAddress,<br />p.PersonEmailAddress1, p.PersonEmailAddress2, ups.* FROM PROFILE p<br />LEFT JOIN UserPrivacySettings ups ON p.Username = ups.UsernameFK WHERE<br />:criteria ORDER BY p.Username ASC';<br />   $count_query = 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PROFILE';
<p>   $this-&gt;source = new MigrateSourceMSSQL($this-&gt;db, $query, $count_query);<br />   $this-&gt;destination = new MigrateDestinationUser();</p>
<p>   // Mapped fields<br />   $this-&gt;addFieldMapping('name', 'Username');<br />   $this-&gt;addFieldMapping('mail', 'EmailAddress');<br />   $this-&gt;addFieldMapping('status')<br />        -&gt;defaultValue(1);<br /> }</p>
<p> function prepare(stdClass $account, stdClass $row) {<br />   // Give these users an email address so the account is valid.<br />   if (empty($account-&gt;mail)) {<br />     $account-&gt;mail = $row-&gt;Username . '@example.com';<br />   }</p>
<p>   $map = array(<br />     'field_hometown' =&gt; 'HomeTown',<br />     'field_birthday' =&gt; 'Birthday',<br />     'field_spouse' =&gt; 'Spouse',<br />     'field_little_known_facts' =&gt; 'LittleKnownFacts'<br />     'my_contacts' =&gt; 'MyContacts',<br />     'field_primary_email' =&gt; 'PrimaryEmail',<br />     'field_work_phone' =&gt; 'WorkPhone',<br />     'field_mobile_phone' =&gt; 'MobilePhone',<br />   );<br />   foreach ($map as $drupal =&gt; $mssql) {<br />     if (isset($row-&gt;$mssql)) {<br />       $account-&gt;cck_profile_privacy[$drupal] = $row-&gt;$mssql;<br />     }<br />   }<br /> }<br />}</p>
<p>The highlights here are:</p>
<ul><li>Specify a mapping between the source id (username) and the destination ID (user ID).
</li><li>Provide a fetch query which pulls columns from the source.
</li><li>Provide mappings<br />
between source columns and properties in the Drupal $user object.
</li><li>Use the 'prepare' hook to massage data that can't be directly mapped. Here we provide an email address where none<br />
exists in the source. Drupal is a bit unhappy when it doesn't have an email for a user. We also build an array of profile privacy values in the user object. </li></ul>Write Destination Plugins
<p>Migrate and <a href="http://drupal.org/prject/migrate_extras">Migrate Extras</a> modules provide lots of plugins which know how to insert and report on data managed by CCK, Location, Flag, etc. Here is an example of such a plugin written for the Forum. This plugin is for migration of Organic Group (OG) Memberships:</p>
class MigrateDestinationOGMembership extends MigrateDestination {
<p>	function getKeySchema() {<br />	   return array(<br />	     'gid' =&gt; array(<br />	       'type' =&gt; 'int',<br />	       'not null' =&gt; TRUE,<br />	       'description' =&gt; 'NID of group',<br />	     ),<br />	     'uid' =&gt; array(<br />	       'type' =&gt; 'int',<br />	       'not null' =&gt; TRUE,<br />	       'description' =&gt; 'UID of member',<br />	     ),<br />	   );<br />	 }</p>
<p>	 /**<br />	  * Delete a membership.<br />	  * @param $id<br />	  *  ID to be deleted.<br />	  */<br />	 function rollback(array $id) {<br />	   og_delete_subscription($id['gid'], $id['uid']);<br />	 }</p>
<p>	 /**<br />	  * Import a single membership.<br />	  *<br />	  * @param $entity<br />	  *  Object object to build. Prefilled with any fields mapped in the Migration.<br />	  * @param $row<br />	  *  Raw source data object - passed through to prepare/complete handlers.<br />	  * @return array<br />	  *  Array of key fields of the object that was saved if<br />	  *  successful. FALSE on failure.<br />	  */<br />	 function import(stdClass $entity, stdClass $row) {<br />	   if (empty($entity-&gt;gid)) throw new MigrateException('Missing $entity-&gt;gid');<br />	   if (empty($entity-&gt;uid)) throw new MigrateException('Missing $entity-&gt;uid');</p>
<p>	   $args = array(<br />	     'is_active' =&gt; $entity-&gt;is_active,<br />	     'is_admin' =&gt; $entity-&gt;is_admin,<br />	     'created' =&gt; $entity-&gt;created,<br />	   );<br />	   og_save_subscription($entity-&gt;gid, $entity-&gt;uid, $args);</p>
<p>	   // No failure handling in OG<br />	   return array($entity-&gt;gid, $entity-&gt;uid);<br />	 }</p>
<p>	function fields() {<br />	  return array(<br />	     'gid' =&gt; 'Group node id',<br />       'uid' =&gt; 'User ID',<br />       'is_active' =&gt; 'User\'s group membership is active (1) or pending (0)',<br />       'is_admin' =&gt; 'Is member an administrator in this group',<br />       'created' =&gt; 'Create date for this membership. Defaults to time()',<br />	);<br />     }<br />}</p>
<p>As you can see, a destination plugin is a pretty simple class. This one implements 4 brief methods. The most important one is the import() method, which handles the saving into Drupal for each record in the source data. We use the OG API functions to do so, so that all hooks are properly called and contrib/custom modules can react as needed. This plugin is now part of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/migrate_extras">Migrate Extras module</a>.</p>
Summary
<p>Thanks to this project and others, Migrate module now knows how to import into all the various Drupal features that make up a social networking site. You can import friends, points, groups, flags, etc. Go forth and confidently re-launch you social networking features with Drupal. </p>

For years, it's been possible to do that with the Views module by craftily combining two views: one for the first node, another for the remaining ones. While that approach gets points for craftiness, it's cumbersome and forces you to maintain two separate View displays. Thankfully, the newly-released <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_nodes_split">Views Nodes Split</a> module has made the trick simple.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lullabot.com/sites/lullabot.com/files/views-split.png" class="fancy" alt="Screenshot of the Views Nodes Split configuration screen" /></p>
<p>Setting up the module is simple: just turn it on, and build your View as you normally would. Then, click on the View's Format option and select the newly available "Splited Content" row style. While the grammar is awkward, the results are great: you can specify separate build modes and display styles for the first node and all subsequent nodes from a simple config screen. In fact, you can even adjust where the cutoff happens: you might want the first three nodes to display in full, for example. No other changes are needed for your View; this module's new row style handles the rest.</p>

The folks at the Austin Camp do a great job.  I enjoyed this year just as much as last year.  I didn't go to many sessions, but a big part of that had to do with putting last minute additions on my <a href="http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org/sessions/project-management-using-hybrid-agile-development">presentation</a> today.  Conversations last night had me swapping around a few slides and adjusting my presentation a little bit.  If you want, you can look at my <a href="http://www.dogstar.org/drupal/node/1063">slides</a>, though I think that without the context of the dialogue, they will make less sense.  Thank you to the Drupalcamp Austin organizing team for inviting me to come and speak.  It really was a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Ready to Present</strong><br />
I've been preparing for the last few weeks for today's keynote.  It really started coming together over the last week.  To make sure I wasn't going to have a "train wreck" in front of 300 people I used <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/">Screen Flow</a> to record my session over and over and over again and then enjoy the pain of watching myself mess up and add additional notes to the presentation.  I was pleased to give my perspectives on how the Examiner.com process has changed, grown, and shifted in such positive ways.  Hopefully others can learn from our lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media, Tweets, Posts, and Photos</strong><br />
Thanks to everyone who sent supportive tweets and Facebook posts.  I really appreciated hearing from you.  Tweets during the session all seemed positive with Matt Kleve <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/vordude/status/138352083014393856">(vordude)</a> asking a really nice question:<br />

                    <p>Organic Groups is one of those modules that have had <em>major</em> changes beween Drupal 6 and Drupal 7. While the D6 version (due to legacy) had its own solutions for lists, group audience and other things, the new version utilizes entities and fields to its fullest – and relies on <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> for creating lists of just about any&nbsp;type.</p>
<p>The benefits of <em>not</em> creating its own solutions for associating data with entities and creating lists is greatly increased flexibility. The Drupal 7 version will not – like the D6 version – have sub modules like <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ogflickrblock">Organic Groups Flick block</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/og_profiles">Organic group profiles</a> or other modules that provide functionality that you normally expect to get by combining OG with your Drupal framework module of&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>The cost of relying on other modules, though, is increased complexity. Organic Groups comes with a nice example feature that sets up the most common configuration in a snap, but to really make use of the module you need to know how to use relationships and contextual filters in Views, how to use relationships and Views content panes in Page manager, and how access and utilize data in&nbsp;Rules.</p>
<p>The screencast series <a href="http://nodeone.se/node/1085">Learn Organic groups</a> tries to explain how to use OG and make the most out of it, by using it together with other important Drupal modules. I hope it will be&nbsp;useful.</p>

                    <p>I was walking back home from work and thinking to myself Drupal thoughts. One of the thought was about OG7 and its use of "group" entity. At the time of writing OG it seemed as a good idea. It allows flexibility of showing all the groups of the site, without worrying what entity type they are (as the group ID isn’t equal to the node ID).<br />
It also allows easier internalization of group nodes, as again the group ID isn’t the node ID.<br />
In a very Drupal like way, in the other side of the world, a day later fago was asking the same question.</p>
<p>After more than a year that OG7 is out, it seems that the flexibility of showing all the groups at once has a price in complexion. It makes Views require one more relationship. It makes Panels require one more relationship. It makes creating Rules and using tokens a non-intuitive task.<br />
I've opened a new <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1342632">issue</a>, with one thing in mind -- deprecating the group entity, and making OG even slimmer and even more robust.<br />
The idea is to rely on the new kid on the block - Entity Reference, which means your reference field will know how to reference a group of a single entity type. That change will result with changing the signature of a lot of function in OG (i.e. instead of passing the group ID, one will have to pass the entity type of the group, and the entity ID of the group), but it will also result with better UX and DX.</p>
<p>The idea is to create a 2.x branch, to allow people to migrate from 1.x. I honestly don’t think it will be very painful, as I’ll provide automatic migration of data. So it will be just a matter of updating the Views, Panels and custom code.<br />
In the above issue there are already comments from known community members giving it a big +1, and saying "Let’s see this sooner than later". I also want to see this happening <em>fast</em>, but my time resources are not enough.</p>
<p>I’m looking for someone to sponsor this huge and non-trivial feature, which will cost US$7,500<br />
Please do <a href="http://www.gizra.com/contact">contact</a> me if you are interested. I will credit you on the OG module page, in the README file, and on my personal blog. The community will thank you greatly.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>The marvelous <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">drush</a> makes an enormous number of things possible that would otherwise be tedious at best, and allows us to automate a shocking number of Drupal tasks.</p>
<p>But it has a dark side. Drush does tasks that would normally be done by the webserver (cron, update.php, enabling modules), and that means that it can leave files laying around that the webserver may not be able to access and control. It also does jobs that would normally be done by a site maintainer ( drushpm-download, drushpm-updatecode)  from the command line. These <em>should</em> create files that are not writeable by the webserver.</p>
<p>The results of this dark side can cause enormous confusion to Drupal developers. If you do a  drush cron as yourself and cron happens to write some files in sites/default/files, (for example, updating CSS or JS cache files), those files will <em>never</em> by default be deletable or possibly editable by the webserver, meaning that Drupal will never be able to properly handle those files.  The flip side is that if you do a command like " drushcc all" as yourself your drushcommand will not be able to delete or possibly edit files that were created (normally) by the webserver.</p>
<p>I have debugged dozens of broken websites with subtle breakage (most of them my own) that were broken in this way.</p>
<p>In the future, I'd hope to see drush figure out how to categorize which of its jobs should be done as the webserver user and which should be done as a non-webserver user, and offer to do that for you (using sudo).   But right now, here is some background and some workarounds to go with that background.</p>
<p>(Note: The problems described here are common to almost all Unix/Linux servers, but usually do not affect Windows, Mac, CPanel, or Dreamhost shared hosting users. That's because  traditional Unix servers run the webserver as a separate user ("www-data" on Debian/Ubuntu, "apache" normally on RedHat/CentOS.)</p>
Concepts
<ul><li>In Linux, every file and directory has an "owner" and a "group". Every user has a primary group. And every file has read, write, and execute permissions for owner, group, and all. </li>
<li>When a Linux user creates a file or directory, that file or directory by default gets the "owner" of the user that created it and the "group" of the primary group of the user that created it.</li>
<li>Only a user with permissions to <em>write</em> in a directory has permissions to delete or rename a file.</li>
</ul>Workarounds
<ul><li>Add yourself and anybody who might use drush to the webserver's group (www-data on Debian/Ubuntu). This will give you permissions, when using drush as a normal user, to update files created by the webserver (but you still won't be able to delete files like CSS aggregation files created by the webserver)</li>
<li>Please, please never do a "sudo drush" or run drush as root. This can leave scattered files laying around that neither you <em>nor</em> the webserver can access. If you think you need to use sudo with drush something else is badly wrong. Unless, of course, you manage all your sites and files as root, which is another huge mistake from a system reliability and security perspective.</li>
<li>When issuing drush commands that do things the webserver would normally do (cron, updatedb, enable, disable, cc, running simpletest tests) use sudo -u [webserver_user] drush [whatever], which runs drush as the webserver user. So, on Debian/Ubuntu: sudo -u www-data drush cc all</li>
<li>Make the files directory (and private files directory) and everything below them have the group of the webserver and be writable by the webserver user:<br />
sudo chgrp -R www-data sites/default/files  # Make all files have group www-data<br />
sudo chmod -R ug+rw sites/default/files   #Grant write permission to user and group recursively<br />
sudo chmod g+s sites/default/files   # Set the "sticky" bit so all files created inside will have group of directory</li>
</ul>Some examples of failures
<p>OK, maybe you're not taking me seriously :-)</p>
<ul><li>Install <a href="http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate">Backup and Migrate</a> and install it for the first time using drush. drush en -y backup_migrate and then do a manual backup drush bb. By doing those two things you have created the backup_migrate directory... but with your own permissions. Backup Migrate can never write to that directory, and all accesses by the webserver will fail. And generally we want backups to succeed :-)</li>
<li>Use drush cc css+js to to clear all js and css aggregation files in sites/default/files/css, etc. If the files there are more than 30 days old (D7), you'll get these errors and the files won't be deleted, and sadly you'll see these messages forever, every time you clear the cache or do any action that clears the cache, until you go in and delete the files or solve the permissions problem. This is no great tragedy, but it just demonstrates what we're talking about:<br />unlink(/home/quickstart/websites/example.dev/sites/default/files/css/css_0HZDHWccQCzJ2oHZ0hVqMjDA4BAT77eUWYWDqQbAEM0.css):[warning]<br />Permission denied in drupal_unlink() (line 2139 of<br />/home/quickstart/websites/example.dev/includes/file.inc).</li>
<li>Install <a href="http://drupal.org/project/css_injector">CSS Injector</a> using drush (drush dl css_injector; drush en -y css_injector&lt;/code). Now when you go to try to create a CSS rule (which creates a file in the directory sites/default/files/css_injector, which the webserver doesn't have write access to, you'll get<br />Error message<br />The directory /home/quickstart/websites/example.dev/sites/default/files/css_injector is not writable</li>
</ul><p>These are just a few examples of unintended consequences of of using drush without understanding what happens with file permissions. There are many more.</p>
<p>If you use the workarounds described above, you can ameliorate all of these. If you don't, you can debug forever or be dogged by these problems forever.</p>
Resources on <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">drush</a>:

<li><a href="http://drupal.org/node/990812">This issue</a> describes a partial approach to the permissions problem.</li>
</ul>Armageddon
<p>OK, I might have overstated the consequences. Not Armaggeddon, but really important to the stability of your website.</p>

    <p>After <a href="http://hojtsy.hu/multilingual-drupal7">reviewing language support and translation for many of Drupal's pieces</a>, we arrived at a pretty complex question, building multilingual navigation. The question is especially of importance because we often need to put translated content in menus, and the cross of translation of content and translation of menus can easily get us into the woods. Let's build some simple solutions for different use cases to see how to think of multilingual menus.</p>

    <p>Drupal isn't only for work: it's also for play, as "FarmVille" creator <a href="http://www.zynga.com">Zynga</a> proves. While their games usually appear as apps on social networks such as Facebook, its main site is on <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>.  It's a terrific example of how Drupal is used in the entertainment industry.  After all, Zynga's annual revenue in 2010 was almost a billion US dollars, and is aiming for an initial public offering that values the company at $15-20 billion.</p>
