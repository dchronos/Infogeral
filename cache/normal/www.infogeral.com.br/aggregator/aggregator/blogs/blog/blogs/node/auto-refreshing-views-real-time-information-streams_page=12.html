      <a href="/aggregator/sources/1" class="feed-item-source">Ultimas noticias do drupal</a> -
      <span class="feed-item-date">sex, 18/11/2011 - 16:01</span>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    
      
          <p>It is very common that sometimes when you import content from a file (eg. CSV or XML file) which is provided by someone else, you are not pleased with the format. You might see many inconsistency values which obviously would need some improvements in order to have a clean import.</p>

<p>That is when <a href="http://drupal.org/project/feeds_tamper" target="_blank">Feeds Tamper module</a> comes to save your task. It comes with multiple plugins which manipulates values before mapping them. That gives great power for site builders to have clean feeds imports with consistent values.</p>

<p>However, sometimes you will not find your plugin to do something you want and that is why I write you how to write your custom plugin for feeds tamper.</p>

<p>Lets use products as a real-life example. I have an CSV file which contains product's EAN code, product ID, title and color. I find out that CSV file has inconsistency on product ID's where some of them are prefixed with zeros and some of them are not.</p>

<p>
<strong>products.csv</strong></p>product id;product ean;product title;product color
001;123456;Black mug;Black
002;123457;Grey mug;grey
3;123458;Green mug;Green
04;123459;Drupal T-shirt;White, Blue
05;;Mystery product;
10;1234510;iPad;
999;1234511;Audi TT Coupé;



<p>Product ID's appear to be three digit numbers prefixed by zeros. We would like to have products imported with consistent ID's so we want to make sure that they have ID's like '001', '003', '003', '010' and '999', etc.</p>

<p>When I wrote this custom plugin first time (before 7.x-1.0-beta3) there were no plugin for pad strings so I wrote my own plugin. That's the one I'm going to use now in this example.</p>

<p>Feeds Tamper uses <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ctools" target="_blank">ctools</a> plugin system to let other modules determine their tamper plugins. To let Feeds Tamper module know about our new plugin we need to implement hook_ctools_plugin_directory() to tell ctools that our tamper plugins are found in a specified path. In this case that would be 'custom_plugins/'.</p>

<strong>example_tamper_plugin/example_tamper_plugin.module</strong>
&lt;?php
function example_tamper_plugin_ctools_plugin_directory($owner, $plugin_type) {
  if ($owner == 'feeds_tamper' &amp;&amp; $plugin_type == 'plugins') {
    return 'custom_plugins/';
  }
}
?&gt;


<p>Next step is to describe our plugin so Feeds Tamper knows what to call in certain events. You do that by creating a PHP file into the plugins directory and determining $plugin variable as follow:</p>

<strong>example_tamper_plugin/custom_plugins/example_str_pad.inc</strong>
&lt;?php
$plugin = array(
  'form' =&gt; 'example_tamper_plugin_str_pad_form',
  'callback' =&gt; 'example_tamper_plugin_str_pad_callback',
  'name' =&gt; 'Custom pad',
);
?&gt;


<p>
<strong>form</strong> - is the function name which gets called when feeds tamper look for plugin settings<br /><strong>callback</strong> - is the function name where the actual magic happens<br /><strong>name</strong> - obviously, the name of the plugin<br /></p>

<p>Now lets implement settings form for our plugin. The whole magic will happen using str_pad() function so we will take look for all available parameters and figure out settings from those. <em>Length</em> will be required setting and optional settings could be <em>string</em> and <em>type</em>. <em>Length</em> tells how long the string should be at least. <em>String</em> is the character which will be used to complete the string length when string length condition is not met. <em>Type</em> tells which side it will fill the string.</p>

<strong>example_tamper_plugin/custom_plugins/example_str_pad.inc</strong>
&lt;?php
function example_tamper_plugin_str_pad_form($importer, $element_key, $settings) {
  $form = array();
  $form['length'] = array(
    '#type' =&gt; 'textfield',
    '#title' =&gt; t('Length'),
    '#description' =&gt; t('If the value of length is negative, less than, or equal to the length of the input string, no padding takes place.'),
    '#default_value' =&gt; isset($settings['length']) ? $settings['length'] : '',
    '#size' =&gt; 4,
    '#required' =&gt; TRUE,
  );
  $form['string'] = array(
    '#type' =&gt; 'textfield',
    '#title' =&gt; t('String'),
    '#size' =&gt; 10,
    '#description' =&gt; t('The string may be truncated if the required number of padding characters can\'t be evenly divided by the string\'s length.'),
    '#default_value' =&gt; isset($settings['string']) ? $settings['string'] : ' ',
  );
  $form['type'] = array(
    '#type' =&gt; 'radios',
    '#title' =&gt; t('Type'),
    '#options' =&gt; array(STR_PAD_RIGHT =&gt; t('Right'), STR_PAD_LEFT =&gt; t('Left'), STR_PAD_BOTH =&gt; t('Both')),
    '#default_value' =&gt; isset($settings['type']) ? $settings['type'] : STR_PAD_RIGHT,
  );
  return $form;
}
?&gt;


<p>If you would now clear your caches you should already have your plugin listed in the dropdown list of available plugins.</p>

<img src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/feeds-tamper.png" alt="View of custom pad plugin settings form." /><p>Next step is to implement the actual callback function which gets called when feeds tamper deals with the import. Feeds Tamper will take action when hook_feeds_after_parse() is invoked. It looks for enabled plugins for each element and then call the callback functions. We have determined the callback function to be example_tamper_plugin_str_pad_callback so lets implement that.</p>

<strong>example_tamper_plugin/custom_plugins/example_str_pad.inc</strong>
&lt;?php
function example_tamper_plugin_str_pad_callback($result, $item_key, $element_key, &amp;$field, $settings) {
  $type = isset($settings['type']) &amp;&amp; in_array($settings['type'], array(STR_PAD_RIGHT, STR_PAD_LEFT, STR_PAD_BOTH)) ? $settings['type'] : STR_PAD_RIGHT;
  $field = str_pad($field, intval($settings['length']), $type);
}
?&gt;


Not that bad, huh? $field is the value which was parsed by feeds and since it's passed as reference, you just edit the value and that's all. You'll get $settings to use your settings you earlier implemented.

    <p>Hiring Drupal developers is difficult. Hiring great Drupal developers in the current market often feels close to impossible. They are highly sought after and most of the people on the market, in all honesty, aren’t very good.

<p>I’ve put together a list of the <a href="http://thereq.com/q/best-drupal-software-interview-questions/all">best Drupal interview questions</a> that I’ve used over the years to screen Drupal candidates.

  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>As I mentioned in a <a href="http://cmsreport.com/blog/2011/book-club-modx-official-guide">previous post</a>, I'm currently playing catch-up in discussing all the good books sent my way this past year. Many of the books have been sent by the authors and publishers themselves for review and some of the books I've bought on my own dime. There should be no further evidence that I'm a procrastinator in posting book reviews than this particular review of Todd Tomlinson and John K. Vandyyk's <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430228387"><em>Pro Drupal 7 Development</em></a>. This book was published almost a year ago, and I'm only now finding the time to blog about this book.</p>
<p><img alt="Cover of Pro Drupal 7 Development" src="http://cmsreport.com/files/blog/2011/ProD7.png" />While it has been close to a year since this book was published (about just as long since Drupal 7 was released), I marvel how relevant <em>Pro Drupal 7 Development</em> remains as a valuable resource to me. This book and its<a href="http://cmsreport.com/blog/2007/drupal-book-drupal-developer-wannabe"> previous versions</a> have saved my hide so many times that I have lost count. This book may have been sitting on my desk for a year but I assure you it hasn't been collecting dust.</p>
<p>If you're going to get any Drupal book in print this is the book you should get if you're going to do any development with Drupal or simply need to troubleshoot your way out of a Drupal related problem. I realize there are a lot of resources available online from the <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal community</a> that contains much of the same material found in this book. However, this book organizes the material in such a thoughtful manner that I find the looking up material via the book more efficient than seeing it out though online search.</p>
<p>Pro Drupal 7 Development updates the most popular development reference for the release of Drupal 7. With several new and completely-rewritten essential APIs and improvements in Drupal 7, this book will not only teach developers how to write modules ranging from simple to complex, but also how Drupal itself works.</p>
<ul><li>Learn the Drupal APIs and major changes in Drupal 7</li>
<li>Learn how to write Drupal modules using the APIs</li>
<li>Learn proper development practices and how to become a contributing community member</li>
</ul>
<p>As I mentioned before, I'm more a Drupal user than a Drupal developer. However, I do find myself at times needing to tweak a contributed module or writing a script to insert data into a node. It is during these times that I pull <em>Pro Drupal 7 Development</em> off my bookshelf. Also, this is the third edition of this book and still my favorite part of the book is the Database Table References found in Appendix A. I don't care how well (or in some cases not so well) Drupal and Drupal's contributed modules are written...after running a Drupal site for several years you're going to find yourself run into an <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/cmsreport/status/136624124700270592">occasional issue</a> with your database. This book continues to give me a better understanding of the Drupal database structure so I find myself able to resolve issues with my tables in minutes rather than in hours.</p>
<p>This book aims to teach you several things about Drupal development including:</p>
<ul><li>How to get started with writing basic modules</li>
<li>The flexible Drupal APIs and how they interact with modules</li>
<li>How new features in Drupal 7 make modules even more powerful and sophisticated</li>
<li>Best practices when developing in Drupal (coding standards, help developer modules)</li>
<li>How to write safe, secure, and tested code</li>
<li>How to contribute modules back to the Drupal community and maintain their modules using the Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</li>
</ul><p>So although Drupal 7 and this book have been around for a year, I still encourage you to buy Pro Drupal 7 Development if you don't already have it on your bookshelf. I of course am hoping we see a Pro Drupal 8 Development book when Drupal 8 is also ready to be released. I would be lost without my <em>Pro Drupal Development</em> book.</p>

          <p>Whew, this has been a busy week for the DrupalCon Denver team!  First things first, the deadline to apply for scholarships for the conference is <strong>today</strong> -- anyone who has not yet applied can <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/scholarships">visit our scholarship page and apply</a> before November 18, 2011 midnight <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20111117T2359&amp;p1=75">Mountain Time</a>.  </p>
<p></p>Sprints, Glorious Sprints
<p>Sprint leads - it's your time to shine. Applicants should be ready to describe in detail the goal (what you plan to improve) and desired outcome (what will be accomplished during the sprint), and have a group of at least 3 sprinters together at the time of application. Sprints can take place at anytime during the conference; they need not happen only on the Friday following the scheduled sessions. Preference is given to sprints that plan for a full day's amount of work, even if it's spread out over several days. Preference is also given to sprints that align with the conference theme or the following categories:<br /></p><ul><li>Documentation</li>
<li>Drupal.org improvements</li>
<li>Drupal Core (Drupal 8 Initiatives or Drupal 7 bug fixes)</li>
<li>Top contrib projects or community improvements</li>
</ul><br />
Applications have already started to roll in. You can <a href="https://association.drupal.org/node/11649">apply online as a Sprint Lead</a>, and to support sprints we're offering a limited number of free attendance tickets. Sprint Lead selections will be announced in January.
<p></p>80% of Session Selections Announced
<p>With the help of our <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/volunteers">DrupalCon Denver volunteers</a>, a list of sessions and speakers that have been officially selected to date is now available online.  This is an exciting preview of what is in store for next March, see what the buzz is all about on <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions">our Sessions List page</a>.  Remember: the remaining sessions still left to be selected will be posting in a preliminary schedule website on December 7, 2011 and a final schedule on January 25, 2012. </p>

    <p>Hiring Drupal developers is difficult. Hiring great Drupal developers in the current market often feels close to impossible. They are highly sought after and most of the people on the market, in all honesty, aren’t very good.
 
<p>CMS developers are an unusual breed. They come from a wide variety of backgrounds, often stumbling into programming. While a non-CS background can bring valuable perspective, if you need a strong generalist on your project you should take extra care to make sure that you’re getting the skill set you require.

                    The new (and old) translation systems, and how they work        
        

<img src="http://www.lullabot.com/sites/lullabot.com/files/imagecache/190x190_rounded/images/entry/entry-image_core-dev-summit_0.png" alt="" title="" hspace="10" align="right" width="190" height="190" /><p>The way that Drupal manages translations has been evolving over several versions of Drupal. It has always been somewhat daunting to figure out how to set up a multilingual site in Drupal, and it requires a combination of core and contributed modules to make it work well. In Drupal 7 we have some great new features, but we also ended up with two different systems of managing content translation, so there are also lots of new questions and options. If you're new to Drupal's multilingual system, or new to Drupal 7, you'll have lots of questions about how to get this working well.</p>
<p>To make this whole process easier we'll cover the following in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the difference between <em>interface</em> and <em>content</em> translation</li>
<li>Discuss the two alternative systems for content translation in Drupal 7 and how they differ</li>
<li>Walk through the installation and set up of a D7 multilingual site</li>
<li>Provide an extensive list of modules, articles, and resources that may be helpful</li>

    As Luke Wroblewski puts it, &quot;Mobile is Exploding&quot;. As smartphone sales surpass PCs and more and more people are doing their casual surfing from the couch or the line in the grocery store, everyone is talking about how to meet mobile user&#039;s needs. Moreover, an increasing number of users are using smartphones or tablets as their only personal computer. We think that for the public sector, especially for any organization that wants to provide equal access to everyone, this means that you need a strategy for reaching these devices.  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>This morning, I checked my queues and found a pointer to a new entity based forum, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/brain_forum" rel="nofollow">Brain Forum</a>. I haven't had a chance to test it out, yet, so I'm only going by the description. According to that, it's already functional, and there's plans for future expansion. Basically, bfr beat me to it. My first thought was, "Now what do I do?" I'm sure people are going to ask why I'm bothering with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/artesian" rel="nofollow">Artesian Forum</a> that's barely started when Brain Forum is already working? </p>
<p>The answer is that it's something I <em>need</em> to do. Forums have been my "thing" for most of my Drupal life. While others have come and gone, I've kept at it, kept working towards my dream of having a native Drupal forum solution that can compete with the big boys as well as do things that make it unique to Drupal. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/advanced_forum" rel="nofollow">Advanced Forum</a> was a good attempt but has fundamental issues that were holding me back. With Artesian, I'm making a clean start and taking my time to do it slowly and carefully and plan it out so I can get to where I want to go with no roadblocks. I have been planning it in my head for a year and am excited to get to work on it. My head is bursting with ideas that I just need to see through. While the project was barely started and then delayed for 6 months due to illness and other personal issues, I'm on the verge of really diving in and making it happen.</p>
<p>I'm not doing Artesian for a client or even really for my own use. My <a href="http://couleeregion.com/forum" rel="nofollow">Coulee Region forum</a>, which birthed Advanced Forum, has been a dismal failure because it turns out I'm better at writing forum software than managing a forum. While I'm sure I'll use Artesian, I could live without it. I'm writing it because it is my dream to provide a kick-ass forum for Drupal. This is what I do for the community. This is my thing. And I can't just walk away from that just because someone with more resources came along and beat me to it. If that makes me a hypocrite for duplicating effort after I spent so long fighting against duplication, so be it. I will do my part to ease user confusion by making sure I document well and explain the choices once Artesian is a viable solution. But I <em>need</em> to do Artesian regardless of what anyone else is doing. It's just something I've gotta do.</p>
<p>And what about Advanced Forum? That was my "baby" for four years and I haven't just abandoned it. I have found it solid caretakers in mcdruid (D6) and troky (D7). While I'm still involved in the issue queue, I'm no longer actively coding on it. The new maintainers are doing a fine job of keeping it going and I expect the module to keep going for quite some time yet, possibly even after Artesian is viable. Artesian is based on entities, not on core forum, and is a major design jump. Some people may be happy staying with Advanced Forum. We'll see when the time comes. Either way, there will be data conversion available from Core Forum (which means Advanced Forum as well) to Artesian Forum</p>
<p>So, what should you use?</p>
<p>If you need a solution <em>right now</em> look at Advanced Forum and Brain Forum. Not having used BF, I can't say much about it. I can tell you that AF has issues with large forums both due to performance and due to lack of moderation tools. It works great for small forums, though.</p>
<p>If you're doing long term planning, 6+ months, keep Artesian in mind. I intend to have something usuable (not necessarily in production) by DrupalCon and hope to make use of some of the brilliance there to really kick it into shape. I'd like to have something production ready by Summer but I can't make promises that far out. What I <em>can</em> promise you is that, short of something bad happening to me, I'm not going anywhere. I've been a member of this community since 2005 and working on forums since 2007. This is my passion, not just an assignment, and I will not give up until I give Drupal a forum that I am proud of.</p>

                    <p>One of the most common complaints that I have heard against CSS preprocessors, such as Sass and Less, is that you have to change your workflow because you can&#8217;t see on which line in the CSS file a property is set on when looking in Firebug.

<p>In any type of community - be it software or something else - with a large, diverse group of people actively participating and contributing, there is going to be conflict.  An important thing to understand, therefore, is how to resolve conflicts effectively so that the purpose of the group is not adversely affected.  In this episode I discuss conflict resolution in the Drupal community with Randy Fay and Greg Knaddison, two prominent people in the Drupal community who have a lot of experience with conflict resolution.</p>

This one actually turned out to be significantly easier to setup and use than I had originally thought it would be.</p>
<p>The beauty of this module is that you can upload virtually ANY format of video, and Zencoder will pick it up and convert it to whatever format you would like it to be. Zencoder has such a large <a href="http://zencoder.com/formats/" rel="nofollow">list of compatible formats</a> that it's easier to name the unsupported formats, because there are only a few. The next great thing about the video module is it's integration with Amazon S3. All of your videos can be automatically sent to, and served from, a bucket on Amazon S3. This means that your videos are served from one of the largest Content Deliver Networks (CDN) available! Think about the load this takes off of your server! You could run a YouTube clone on a cheap shared host like <a href="http://www.hostmonster.com/track/modulesunraveled" rel="nofollow">Hostmonster</a>. (I use Hostmonster, and LOVE them by the way!)</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you find this series useful! let me know what else you would like to see on my site!</p>

    <p>With <a href="http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org" title="DrupalCamp Austin 2011">DrupalCamp Austin</a> coming up this weekend, the web chefs have been working overtime to make things a bit easier on everyone at the camp. We&#8217;ve relaunched the website so that it works on everyone&#8217;s mobile devices while they hustle about between sessions. Instead of building a separate app, we&#8217;ve baked this mobile friendliness straight into the website using <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive web design</a>.</p>
Double website, all the&nbsp;way
<p>Talk of responsive design has been all over the web lately because it allows us to deliver really diverse user experiences within one package. This is especially handy for DrupalCamp sites because there are two main audiences: desktop users who want to learn about the event or register, and mobile camp attendees needing easy access to timely information, especially the&nbsp;schedule.</p>
<p>I expect more and more DrupalCamp sites to start building responsive themes to improve their camp-goers&#8217; experiences. If camps aren&#8217;t big enough to convince you, look no further than <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org">DrupalCon Denver</a> to see a well-designed responsive conference&nbsp;site.</p>
Where can I learn&nbsp;more?!?
<p>I&#8217;m so glad you asked! DrupalCamp Austin is offering <a href="http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org/training">many training sessions</a> this year, including a <a href="http://2011.drupalcampaustin.org/training/responsive-drupal-theming-and-design">Responsive Drupal theming and design</a> training on Sunday by myself and Todd. On Saturday we&#8217;ll have some fantastic mobile-oriented&nbsp;sessions:</p>

    <p>You may have noticed the nice little g+ icon on the site, I've started using a Google+ Page to deliver and organize information about the Contextual Administration module I maintain. This is an interesting new use scenario for me, and I wanted to share what I'm doing and why.</p>

Disclaimer<p>
Everyone knows that the project system on Drupal.org needs a little love. As I understand it it's actually getting that love right now and we just haven't seen the results on the live site yet, so I eagerly await that future, and this is not meant to detract form it at all.</p>

<p>Maintaining a module that is inherently complex, I often find that video is the best way of expressing how to utilize the module to its greatest extent. Similarly I try to continue active development on the module, but this blog and my twitter account is about the limit of platform I've devised thus far to discuss what I'm doing and why. I would very much like to open a conversation about these things in a non-issue-queue area, but that has just seemed very impossible thus far. Then last week-ish google+ released their new pages system so I decided to see if it could function in some greater capacity than what I had managed with this blog thus far. I won't claim to have succeeded, but there are some key "win" points here that are worth discussing.</p>

Blog + Share = WIN!<p>
The ability to have content re-shared across all of google+ is a big deal. My posts aren't getting much in the way of traction there yet, but still people I don't know are sharing my posts with their followers, and that's encouraging.</p>

Photo Albums = WIN!<p>
Yeah that seems odd at first, except that g+ allows me to organize these by album, and I can upload videos instead of photos. Organizing the videos, in order, is awesome because while I just finished my first video series, I'm intending to start a new one shortly and logically separating these topics by the "feature" I'm building is REALLY beneficial.</p>

<p>The only missing thing for me is the ability to build a help system, and really drupal.org is probably a much better place for that in any event. If you want to see what I'm doing here, maybe steal some ideas and improve upon them or share them, please just click the google+ icon on the page.</p>

Future?<p>
It'd be amazing if I could build some deeper functionality between my existing blog (here) and my g+ pages. Probably should dig into the g+ apis and see what's available, but thus far I'm very satisfied.</p>  </div>

    <p>Given that there live one billion people in India, many of which great engineers, one can only imagine what would happen if Drupal gained serious traction in India. To that extend, I decided to make a trip to India, and spent last week in India with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobsingh">Jacob Singh</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ronald-c-pruett-jr/1/a79/98b">Ron Pruett</a> from Acquia.  The purpose of the trip was to increase awareness of Drupal in India that in 3 ways: 
<ol>
 <li>by organizing DrupalCamps to help create a grassroots community of volunteer developers, freelancers and small to medium-sized Drupal shops (bottom-up strategy),</li>
 <li>by talking to the large system integrators that will employ hundreds of Drupal developers (top-down strategy),</li>
 <li>by doing traditional PR with the media and press.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Together with Acquia's partners, we organized 3 DrupalCamps: nearly 300 people showed up in Delhi, 200 people showed up in Mumbai and 350 people showed up in Hyderabad. In addition, I gave a fourth keynote at ISB, India's premier business school, where about 150 people attended.  At each of these events, more people showed up than originally expected.  More importantly, this implies that there must be thousands of Drupal developers in India alone, especially since we didn't visit many other big cities like Bangalore, Pune, Chennai, etc.</p>


 <a href="http://buytaert.net/album/india-2011/drupalcamp-deccan-registration"><img src="http://buytaert.net/sites/buytaert.net/files/cache/india-2011-drupalcamp-deccan-registration-500x500.jpg" alt="DrupalCamp Deccan registration" /></a>



<p>Furthermore, we met various large system integrators in India: Accenture, Capgemini, Wipro, Virtusa, Cognizant, and more.  Each of these are multi-billion IT sevices companies that employ thousands of engineers in India.  Most of them have 1,000+  employees in their content management practices alone. Many are using Vignette, Liferay, Adobe CQ5, OpenText and Alfresco. Joomla! and WordPress seemed non-existent with the large system integrators, but all of them were eagerly starting to build a Drupal practice.  The size of their Drupal teams ranged from 30 to 120 Drupal people, with all of them trying to hire 5 to 15 new people a month.  All of them were rather bullish about Drupal and were hearing about it directly from their clients across the globe.</p>

<p>In general, I'd say that the Drupal community is about 3 or 4 years behind with the Drupal community in North America and Europe.  However, they are catching up fast and it won't take long before many of the world's biggest Drupal projects are delivered from India.</p>

<p>Our ears perked when we learned time after time that well-known Drupal sites that we assumed were developed in the US or Europe were primarily delivered from India.  And it didn't stop there; we learned that the Indian teams are also instrumental in the sales and pre-sales process. They are often responsible for making the CMS platform decisions for all of their clients regardless of country or industry.  In other words, a lot of decisions are made in India and it is of strategic importance that the large system integrators have a good understanding of Drupal. They recognize this is important to their success, and all want to invest in training to build more capacity and to increase the expertise of their existing teams.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Indian culture is big on software training and professional certification, more so than anywhere else in the world. All Drupal companies -- small or large -- asked about training and professional certification.</p> 

<p>Another highlight is that at DrupalCamp New Delhi, about 15 Drupal companies from Delhi met for the first time.  Later the same day, we helped organize the first CXO event for Drupal executives.  In many ways, these were formative meetings that reminded me of early DrupalCon meetings.  For the first time, they got to know each other, explored how to work together, started sharing best practices and toyed with the idea of specialization.  I've seen this movie before, and I know what happens when a community of passionate developers start working together.  Exciting times are ahead.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I gave about 15 press interviews, many of which resulted in an article in an Indian newspaper or IT magazine.</p>


 <a href="http://buytaert.net/album/india-2011/press-coverage-1"><img src="http://buytaert.net/sites/buytaert.net/files/cache/india-2011-press-coverage-1-500x500.jpg" alt="Press coverage" /></a>



<p>After 5 days of intensive travel and back to back meetings in three cities, I left India feeling excited about the size of the opportunity for Drupal.  I had never been to India but I'm told that the India of today is quite different than the India of five years ago.  All the more reason to pay close attention about how the local Drupal community will evolve.  I like to believe my trip helped accelerate Drupal's growth in India.</p>

<p>This trip wouldn't be possible without the help of Acquia's partners. Special thanks to Azri Solutions, Blisstering and Srijan who helped make the journey more than successful.</p>  </div>

    <p>We already have the ability to create a drupal action to launch a maestro workflow and trigger that action from drupal.

Maestro has a content type task that automatically will create the relationship between the content node and maestro proceess information but there are cases where the maestro <em>content type</em> task is not used to create the content entities and we did not have an easy way to later link maestro processes with content nodes or other entities.</p>  </div>

<p>I had several conversations around CMI at BADCamp a few weeks ago, which I have attmpted to summarize here.</p>
<p>First off I had a long conversation with yched about how to implement fields in the config api. There are several aspects to this that are tricky.</p>
Field API : Config files layout
<p>We are talking about a file layout like this:</p>
<p>field.&lt;field_name&gt;.xml (field definition)<br />&lt;entity_type&gt;.bundle.&lt;bundle_name&gt;.xml (bundle definition)<br />&lt;entity_type&gt;.bundle.&lt;bundle_name&gt;.instance.&lt;field_name&gt;.xml (instance of a field on a specific bundle)</p>
<p>A nice thing about this is we can get to the bundle metadata without loading all the instances too. While these names are going to get long, they allow us to do things like ask for all the instances on a bundle without introspecting into the files. The different ways in which these might be queried was a topic of conversation several times through the weekend. It may be that at some point we will have to iterate through files to get data out for queries, like right now field_read_fields() and field_read_instances() are just big query builders around the {field_config[_instance]} tables, but obviously we would like to avoid this.</p>
<p>One thing the CMI API needs that came out of this discussion is the ability to list all config entries with a given prefix, <em>but only one level deep</em> (e.g if I want to list all bundles in an entity type, I don’t want the “instance” files).</p>
<p>Apart from fields and instances, Field API also stores properties about bundles, currently in the {variables} table (yes, “ew”) : list of view modes using dedicated display settings, and order/visibility of “extra fields” - e.g. title, poll results... - in forms or displays. The new location for those is not fully decided yet, but probably somewhere under &lt;entity_type&gt;.bundle.&lt;bundle_name&gt;*.</p>
<p>Right now instance definitions contain all display settings for all view modes regardless of the one you need, causing memory bloat. Yched and swentel have been considering the introduction of  “displays” as standalone animals, collecting display properties for all components in an entity (fields, extra-fields, contrib components like field_groups...) for a given view mode. Those would probably live in &lt;entity_type&gt;.bundle.&lt;bundle_name&gt;.display.&lt;view_mode&gt;.xml. Possible clash with the current CMI concepts: granularity for module defaults. The current vision is that modules can provide default config files that will get copied into the actual config store on install. If I’m a module that adds its own fields and instances, I’ll provide the xml files for the fields and instances, and I’ll also want to provide the corresponding <em>parts</em> of the display file. That issue is possibly not limited to Field API : what if I want to provide a default for the ‘page cache’ property without affecting the other properties stored in system.performance.xml ?</p>
Field API : active fields, deleted fields - “state”, not “definition”
<p>One of the oddities of the field system is that when a field is deleted, it isn’t really ‘deleted’. It is marked as deleted, and then the field values are deleted over time through cron. Once all the data is deleted, then the field definition can be deleted.<br />
Also, Field API needs to track which field/instance definitions refer to field types that are currently absent (i.e. the providing module is disabled), and keep them out of the way.</p>
<p>Those informations (‘pending deletion’, ‘active’) are currently written directly in the {field_config<em>} tables. We decided that they are not part of the actual definitions living in the config system (e.g. we don’t want them hand-edited), but pertain to the “state” of the site (along with “cron timestamp” and “search index progress”), and therefore should be stored somewhere in the database - but *not</em> in the {variables} table :-).</p>
<p>API needs : A generic key-value store for what we would currently put in {variables} and doesn’t fit in config files ? (but Field API can use a dedicated table of its own meanwhile)</p>
<p>The absence or appearance of a new file will signal that the instance (bundle, etc) should be deleted or added. This means that we will need a way to get the current list of configuration and compare it against the files in the file system to determine what is new and missing when a load operation is triggered.</p>
<p>Note : the numeric, serial $field[‘id’] used to track fields (i.e. allow “delete field / immediately create new field with the same name while the 1st one is still pending full deletion”) will probably need to be replaced with a UUID for deployability.</p>
CMI : the “from files to active store” flow
<p>This then led us into another discussion on Sunday with davidstrauss, yched, sun, crell, beejeebus, webchick and michaelfavia (and maybe some more.) The main focus of this discussion was how are we going to respond to config being loaded off of disk (i.e. config files deployed or edited by hand) in situations when a module needs to do something more complex than just reading data out of the file and into the active store (for instance, when creating a new field or bundle.) Here is what we came up with.</p>
<ol>
<li>A reload of the active store from files is triggered. This can happen either through the admin UI or through an alternate mechanism like Drush.</li>
<li>You are shown the list of files that have been changed, added, or deleted, and asked if you accept these changes.</li>
<li>If you say yes, then the config system starts calling a hook in every module in the system, in order based on the directed acyclic graph (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph</a>) of the dependencies as defined in the module .info files. This should ensure that processes happen in the correct order, for instance, if a bundle has been created and then a field instance is added to that bundle, the bundle has to be created first. </li>
<li>This function gets passed an object which points to the entirety of the new config. The old config can be accessed through the existing config system if need be.</li>
<li>The modules look at the new config, compare to the old config in any way they care, and act based on it.</li>
<li>When all this is complete (or potentially as it happens), the new config completely overwrites the old config in the active store.</li>
</ol>
<p>The important breakthrough in this conversation was that the config system should not track who owns or needs to act on changes. It is up to the modules themselves to act however they need to based on whatever criteria they have for their use cases. This reload operation will also have to happen on any save() or delete() functions, because it should be triggered whenever the active store is written to. This means CRUD API functions on config objects (e.g. field_create_field()) act merely by writing the new config on disk and triggering a “config reload”. The actual action (e.g. create the storage table) takes place in the ‘config reload hook’.</p>
<p>In theory this system could be modified to handle situations wherein the ordering provided by module dependencies isn’t enough. For instance, say a module is called but it can’t complete its task for some reason. This task could be added to the bottom of the graph to be re-called after the original graph has been completed. As long as the graph keeps shrinking you keep running through it. If it doesn’t shrink for two iterations you can throw an exception.</p>
<p>Implementing that flow is the primary blocker before Field API can try to start moving over to the config system.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>We are pleased to announce that PIFT 6.x-2.7 has been released, and is now deployed on Drupal.org.  PIFT stands for 'project issue file test', and is the d.o component of Drupal's automated testing infrastructure.  This latest release introduces a couple of exciting new features for project maintainers and patch writers, and you may notice some changes to your patch status messages over the next few days as a result ... read on to learn more about the first of these changes and what it means to you.</p>
'Currently Testing' Added to qa.d.o Status Page
<p>As demonstrated in the attached screenshot, the testbot status page now indicates what patch is currently being tested for each testbot.<br /><a href="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFR-currenttest.png" title=""><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFR-currenttest.png" width="480" height="174" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
Test Results now available on Drupal.org
New Testing Tab
<p>As of this morning, git vetted users should notice a new 'Automated Testing' tab on each project page.  Selecting this tab opens a new page, displaying the PIFT 'branch test' results for that project, if available.</p>
<p><a href="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-newtab_0.png" title=""><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-newtab_0.png" width="480" height="342" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>If a project does not have any branch test results available, users can trigger the testing of a new branch using the 'Test Additional Branches' fieldset.  This will trigger a <em>one-time</em> test of the selected branch.  Note that this behavior is different than the 'enable testing' checkbox for a project (which enables <em>recurring</em> testing of that project's branches and patches).</p>
<p><a href="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-queuetest.png" title=""><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-queuetest.png" width="480" height="267" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>Once triggered, the status of that test will be set to 'queued'.  This means that d.o is prepared to send the test request to the testing infrastructure, but the request has not actually been sent yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-queued.png" title=""><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-queued.png" width="480" height="246" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>After a couple of minutes, the testing infrastructure should pick up the test, and d.o changes the test status to 'sent'.</p>
<p><a href="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-sent.png" title=""><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-sent.png" width="480" height="252" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>Typically, testing is only required for development branches (i.e. branches ending in '.x'), and on projects containing simpletest tests.  Performing Branch tests on projects which do not contain simpletest tests is somewhat redundant; so I'd suggest refraining from doing so, if you can.</p>
<p>Once the testing infrastructure has completed the testing, it returns the test status to d.o, which updates the table appropriately.  Clicking the 'View Test' link will take you to the testing results page for that test on qa.drupal.org.</p>
<p><a href="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-viewtest.png" title=""><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-viewtest.png" width="480" height="252" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
When Testing Fails
<p>The most common failure scenario is when the testing completes successfully; but one of the individual tests fail.  Clicking the 'view test' link on d.o takes you to the results page for that test on qa.drupal.org.  If you scroll down the page, you should find a 'Non-pass' section in the test results, which identifies each of the test groups which contain failed tests.  Expanding the group will display the actual test filename, line number, and failure message; which should help you trace down the source of the issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-qatestview.png" title=""><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-qatestview.png" width="480" height="168" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>Occasionally, a test will file with slightly more obscure messages, such as "Unable to initialize database", "Failed during run-tests.sh", or "Unable to initialize checkout directory".  Typically, these messages indicate temporary issues with a particular testbot.  When these are encountered, the suggested approach is to attempt a 're-test' of the branch to try and reproduce the error ... and if reproducible,  create an issue so that the error can be investigated by the testing infrastructure maintainers.</p>
<p>As there is often confusion as to which queue an issue should be posted (PIFR?  PIFT?  Infrastructure?), we've created a new project issue queue to deal strictly with testbot-related issues.  The new queue, found at http://drupal.org/project/testbot, will serve as a one-stop shop for testing related issues ... and we will handle migrating issues from this queue to the actual projects involved as needed.</p>
Known Issues
<p>Occasionally, the testing infrastructure will complete a test, but the result gets lost while being communicated back to the d.o servers.  This is due to an existing (but previously undiscovered) bug in the system, which is made much more apparent with the introduction of the Automated Testing tab.  When this occurs, a test will appear to remain in the 'sent' state for long periods of time ... but clicking through to the test results on qa.d.o will show the test as completed (with a valid Pass/Fail result).</p>
<p><a href="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-removetest.png" title=""><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/PIFT-removetest.png" width="480" height="286" alt="" title="" /></a></p>
<p>While the test result from qa.d.o provides you with the actual result, it is not reflected on d.o ... and because d.o thinks the test is still running, it does not allow for the test to be re-queued through the automated testing tab interface.  In order to resolve this situation, the recommended solution is to remove the stuck test from the automated testing tab display (using the 'remove test' link), and then queue that branch for re-testing using the 'Test Additional Branches' form in the collapsible fieldset.</p>
Next Steps
<p>Over the next few days, we'll begin to roll out the 'Advisory Coder Reviews', which will be the subject of my next post.</p>  </div>
