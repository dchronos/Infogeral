    <p>In an Open Source Content Management System like Drupal, the wide range of contributed modules often leads to multiple solutions and approaches being available to build a feature for a site. With this flexibility, rarely is there a single "best" solution to a given problem. In this series, the Mediacurrent team will cover some of the common features that our clients often request, and what tools we like to select for the job.</p>
<p>With a panel available to debate, what better place to start our series than with <a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels" target="_blank">Panels</a>? This contributed module allows for flexible layout and control of content on a Drupal site. But not everyone is a fan. The Mediacurrent team reflects this, with several strong opinions both for and against the use of this module. Mediacurrent debates:</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>If you've been involved with Drupal for any length of time, you have most likely used the features provided by the Project Suite (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/project" rel="nofollow">project</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/project_issue" rel="nofollow">project_issue</a>, project_release, etc.) on drupal.org, which provide community-critical features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue tracking</li>
<li>Issue e-mail notifications</li>
<li>Release management</li>
<li>Release packaging/downloads</li>
<li>Project usage tracking</li>
<li>Project searching</li>
</ul>
<p>Without the functionality provided by this suite of modules, it would be much harder for the Drupal community to get its work done, and to distribute the fruits of that labor for others to use.</p>
<p>However, if drupal.org is <em>"probably the oldest continuously-running Drupal site"</em><a href="http://drupal.org/node/863568" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, then the Project Suite is one of the oldest code bases in Drupal outside of core.  Although it was originally authored and maintained by <a href="http://drupal.org/user/2" rel="nofollow">Kjartan Mannes</a>, it went through a multi-year period where it was maintained by a variety of contributors, each doing a small part to keep it functioning on drupal.org as Drupal matured.  Unfortunately, this led to a 'just make it work' approach to site upgrades and new features.</p>
<p>In recent years, thanks to the efforts of dww, hunmonk, mikey_p, bdragon, and others, the suite has been significantly rehabilitated, making it both more maintainable for drupal.org and more <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com" rel="nofollow">generally</a> <a href="http://fusiondrupalthemes.com/" rel="nofollow">usable</a>.  However, many warts and design flaws still remain.</p>
<p>The release of Drupal 7 offers a unique opportunity for the future of the Project Suite. Many of Drupal 7's new features enable building this kind of functionality much easier.  We maintainers intend to redesign the suite from the ground up using Drupal 7, and then provide a data migration path from the D6 database schema.  This is a big job, but frankly, so is updating the Project Suite from one version of Drupal to another.  We're inspired by the approach and success of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce" rel="nofollow">Drupal Commerce</a> in doing a similar effort with the wisdom they gained from working on <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ubercart" rel="nofollow">Ubercart</a>, so we're hoping to accomplish something similar in this problem space.  Instead of focusing on just building a product, we want to build a good framework that different products can be built on top of (including a product that can be a drop-in replacement for the D6 version of the Project Suite).</p>
<p>To that end, we've organized a Project Suite D7 Redesign Sprint for October 24th and 25th, the Monday and Tuesday following <a href="http://2011.badcamp.net" rel="nofollow">BADCamp</a>.  The goal of this sprint is straighforward: develop a plan to rebuild the current functionality provided by the Project Suite using Drupal 7, making it both more maintainable by the community, and more usable as a project management tool.  The module co-maintainers will both be present for the sprint, and other interested parties are invited to attend (both in person or remotely via IRC (#drupal-project on freenode) and the issue queues).</p>
<p>We're still locking down the logistics for the sprint itself, including the venue.  It depends on how many people are going to physically participate vs. people who want to contribute remotely.  Although we'll probably be talking about this all weekend at BADCamp and might start earlier, the formal sprint will be approximately 9am-9pm on Monday, and 9am-6pm on Tuesday. <strong>Please leave a comment here on this post with your intentions of joining the sprint so we can make final arrangements.</strong>  Be sure to clearly specify if you'll be here in person or not, which days/times you're available, etc.  I'll privately e-mail everyone who wants to come with the final location so you don't necessarily have to worry about checking back for updates about the details.</p>
<p>After the sprint we'll publish a follow-up post with more information on the plan, and how others in the community can help with the job of the actual rewrite.  To get the process started, I just updated the issue summary at <a href="http://drupal.org/node/834252" rel="nofollow">[meta] Port Project to Drupal 7</a> so interested parties can <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1306444" rel="nofollow">follow (not subscribe!)</a> to that. ;)</p>
<p>We're looking forward to seeing many of you here in the beautiful East Bay this weekend for BADCamp, and we hope some of you can stay and join us for this sprint!</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

    <p>I've had a nice go at making private messaging capabilities for <a href="http://www.flocknote.com/">flockNote</a> work a lot nicer than the out-of-the-box <a href="http://drupal.org/project/privatemsg">Privatemsg</a> module experience, by simplifying everything to the point that it's closer to the Facebook Direct Message system than the normal Privatemsg UX. (Privatemsg is the premiere way of handling private messaging in Drupal. It's already awesome out of the box... just needed a bit more help for our particular site ;-).</p>
<p>One thing I had wanted to do for a while is prefill the subject field of certain messages. I already have the new private message page appear inside an overlay popup after a user clicks on a link to send a private message to another user on the site.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.midwesternmac.com/sites/midwesternmac.com/files/privatemsg-example-prefill-subject.png" alt="Privatemsg prefill subject" width="410" height="272" /></p>
<p>I wanted users sending direct messages regarding certain comments or nodes to have a subject line of 'RE: [node title]' or 'RE: [comment title]' in them so they didn't have to write out a subject on their own. I was prepared to implement a hook_form_alter for the privatemsg form, send a query fragment containing the private message subject in the URL to the new private message page, and then check for it in my form alter to fill it in as the subject... but it turns out the Privatemsg module already has this capability built in!</p>
<p>All you need to do is throw in the subject as an extra argument in the url like so: messages/new/[uid]/[subject]. (You can still throw on query fragments to the end if you need to. In my case, I put a destination on the end so the overlay closes after a message is sent).</p>
<p>Or, in code...</p>
&lt;?php<br />  $account = user_load($node-&gt;uid);<br />  $pm_link_text = t('Send a PM to Author');<br />  $pm_url = privatemsg_get_link($account) . '/' . t('RE: @title', array('@title' =&gt; $node-&gt;title));<br />  $pm_link = l($pm_link_text, $pm_url, array('query' =&gt; array(drupal_get_destination())));<br />?&gt;

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    
    
           <p>Lately, a few things happened in my life. Since 2008 I work at <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1156702">Sogeti</a> (part of Capgemini group) as Senior Drupal Specialist. In this role, I’ve set up a Drupal expertise team, gave trainings and presentations. I was involved in making Sogeti one of the main Drupal players in the Dutch market. Recently, projects are getting bigger and bigger, and my part in these projects is shifting from an all-round Drupal specialist towards a more (sales-/tech) supporting role. Larger projects mean bigger client teams, more overhead and less interaction with people. Where small clients can be very satisfied wth <em>their</em> improved website, large client teams are just content they’ve reached their deadline and then go on to the next project.</p>
<p>For over a year I am thinking of starting my own website development business. Doing projects that challenge me and focussing on really helping clients, instead of just answering their rfp’s and functional designs – as that’s how it often goes with these large tenders. </p>
<p><strong>And now, that’s exactly what happened.</strong></p>
<p>Recently I started <a href="http://www.limoengroen.nl">LimoenGroen</a> (meaning Lime Green), together with <a href="http://drupal.org/user/138715">Eric</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/user/960720">Martijn</a>. LimoenGroen is a small, professional venture in The Netherlands focussing on creating accessible, intuitive and sustainable websites in Open Source software – mainly Drupal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.limoengroen.nl"><img alt="" class="media-image" src="http://www.bariswanschers.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/limoengroen.png" /></a></p>
<p>We believe that websites should be usable by as many visitors as possible. Whether one is browsing a site on a browser, a mobile or a speech reader, one should be able to gather the information needed. Accessibility should not be something a client has to ask (and pay) for. It should be obvious. And by doing so, Google/Bing will be your friend as well. </p>
<em>“People are afraid of the future, of the unknown. If a man faces up to it, and takes the dare of the future, he can have some control over his destiny. That's an exciting idea to me, better than waiting with everybody else to see what's going to happen.” - John H. Glenn</em>

    <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hermida/742146132/" title="Curve by Alfred Hermida, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1083/742146132_ee452d6fa0_z.jpg" width="640" height="414" alt="Curve"></a><br />
The Drupal Learning Curve. A much debated issue. Drupal was <a href="http://drupal.org/node/43031">up to 2005</a> mainly build by people who didn't perse need the tool, were not scratching their own itch but explored the waters of what we call now the semantic web. Creating a tool we love, with a node system that is still ahead in many ways of other systems and with hooks that catch anything. But also a system that up to at least seven didn't give "the user" the best experience when it comes to the interface.</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>And here is where the normal rant ends. Because we need to stop thinking as "Drupal has a high learning curve for the user". Simply because it is false and by saying so we lie, scare of potential "users". Adding content in Drupal 7 is not harder then in for example Wordpress or Joomla;  some fields, a preview, a sumbit and you are done. Sure, there is the everlasting WYSIWYG dilemma, and while Drupal does not deal with this in core it is as easy 'solved' as it is in a CMS where the editor is integrated.</p>
<p>There are at least two problems with "Drupal has a steep learning curve for the user".</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>A fool with a tool, is still a fool</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, we forget to define "'user". Drupal always has the vision to cut the middleman, make the webmaster obsolete, drop the database administrator and give the power of these roles to "the user", the content editor.</p>
<p>The user was traditionally the person responsible for adding content. Now, this person is not just able to create content with adding some data to some field and press submit. This person is also able to make lists of most read items, create new content types and rearrange blocks on the site.</p>
<p>When I said, <i>First and foremost, we forget to define "'user"</i>, I meant, <i>First and foremost, we redefined "user"</i>. And by redefining "user", by enabling a normal person to do things he (m/f) had to call IT before, by giving him the tools to excel beyond his normal duties, we created the UX problem. Where the normal User Interface of a database engineer was the command line, we gave the power of a webinterface as the user interface to the one who wants the change. From the database engineer's point of view a great step forward in UX; from the content editor's point of view a complex UI for something he might need only once in a while. Roles and rights to the rescue, one might think. But you can not undo the complex powerfull interface Joe Blogger sees when he installs Drupal under UID 1.</p>
<p>Drupal doesn't have a bad UI, doesn't have a steep lurning curve. Drupal <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-and-eliminating-middlemen">eliminates the middleman</a> and does this by eliminating the process and procedures around change management of the technical backend and trades this for an unpolished frontend.
</li>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bertboerland/6146023721/" title="Lego duplo upgrade by bertboerland, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6196/6146023721_baa7c00998_z.jpg" width="640" height="478" alt="Lego duplo upgrade"></a></p>
<li><strong>Up or out?</strong>
<p>Second, we traditionally see the learning curve in relation to horizontal growth. We think that one can become a Chx, Unconed or Dries by submitting a blog post, then install Drupal, tweaking the User Interface, making a template, coding a module and then... one becomes a core maintainer. This classic "growth is seen from left to right" diagram tells it all:</p>
<p><img src="http://buytaert.net/sites/buytaert.net/files/images/drupal/learning-curve.jpg"><br />
(copyright <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-learning-curve">Dries</a>)</p>
<p>The truth is we have hunderds of thousands of people on the left and only a handful of people on the right. And most people who are on the right side of the diagram, didn't grow vertically, they grew vertically. They came in with a background in programming, had programmed on other systems and choose Drupal because of it's code, community or license. </p>
<p>And most people on the left are fine to be on the left and don't want to "grow" horizontally, they want to grow vertically. They are good at something and use Drupal for it. And might be good in what they do in the Drupal community and grow in that vertically, not horizontally. They want to become the best testers, community members or write the best documentation. The learning curve there has nothing to do with the tool Drupal, but with the commnuity, the person and the tasks at hand.</p>
<p>In 2005 I read a very well written book on how great leaders stimulate vertical growth as well, let a waiter become the best waiter on the block, not the manager of the cafe. Dries, you still have my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently/dp/0684852861">"First Break All The Rules"</a> :-)</p>
<p>Drupal doesn't have a bad UI, doesn't have a steep learning curve. Drupal should adopt vertical and horizontal growth by eliminating the traditional vision on how people or communities can grow.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelcarruth/871146589/" title="Tricycle by mcarruth, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1236/871146589_e0f599e93f_z.jpg?zz=1" width="640" height="480" alt="Tricycle"></a></p>
<p>So lets do ourselves a favour and stop calling Drupal hard to learn. It is as true as saying "a bike is hard to learn". Biking is not, building or designing a bike is. Ooh, and while we are at it. Stop calling Drupal a WebCMS. </p>  </div>

We wrapped up three jam-packed days of learning and fun at <a href="http://2011.doitwithdrupal.com/">Do It With Drupal</a>. We loved being in Brooklyn, and were happy to see a lot of local folks there, as well as guests from other parts of the U.S. and the world (props to Nigel who traveled all the way from Australia to attend!). We were also pleased to run into many <a href="http://brooklynbeta.org/2011">Brooklyn Beta</a> attendees at 61 Local while we were enjoying the Cadre Hosting party on Thursday night -- networking +1! </p>
We Love Our Attendees!
<p>First, we'd like to thank all of the attendees who took time out of their busy schedules to spend three days with us to listen, learn, share your own experiences, and network. We hope you keep learning and seeking out opportunities to expand your knowledge. We want to keep learning, too -- about what we did well at the conference, and what could be improved for next time. Please add your comments to this post, or <a href="http://2011.doitwithdrupal.com/contact">send us your feedback</a> -- we want to hear it all. </p>
Speakers Rocked It!
<p>Without our <a href="http://2011.doitwithdrupal.com/speakers">wonderful speakers</a> we wouldn't have an event. We greatly appreciate the time and preparation that each speaker put into their presentation. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience with us all. </p>
Sponsors FTW!  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
     <p>This afternoon, I brought <a href="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/blog/tac-ux">my dissection of TAC's UI problems</a> to the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/182594">UX open hours</a> on <a href="http://drupal.org/irc">IRC</a>.  The following mockups are the result.  </p>

<p>With contributions from:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://drupal.org/user/87969">Bojhan</a> (Drupal Usability Expert extraordinaire)</li><li><a href="http://drupal.org/user/712130">Patrick Rogne</a></li><li>Another guy I also talked to at DrupalCampWI... <a href="http://drupal.org/user/12856/track">nevets</a> maybe?</li></ul>

Main configuration screen

<p>The changes in this screen are mostly based on Bojhan's recommendations.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/1_main_screen.png" /></p>

<p>(Yes, I know my handwriting is illegible -- there's a reason I started using computers at a young age.)  I'd like to use existing core syles for enabled vs. disabled, and maybe the little gear doodad from admin/modules for the configure link.  The configure op is always available.  There is no longer an "enable" or "disable" column; those options are moved to the next screen.</p>

Role configuration screen (disabled role)

<p>I'm not sure exactly what this screen should look like, but there are two key parts: the link or button to enable access control for the role, and a message that users with custom roles also receive the authenticated user role.  The text may need to be tweaked.</p>

<p>I had second thoughts after I drew this; the enable link should probably come first.  There should maybe also be some help text, but I don't know where or what.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/2_role_config_disabled.png" /></p>

Role configuration screen (enabled role)

<p>Once the user clicks "enable," more options are loaded.  The "enable" link turns into "disable" (again, probably above the message about the auth role rather than below it).  </p>

<p>The anonymous and authenticated user roles cannot be disabled, so on those screens there is no disable link (nor, obviously, the message abou tthe authenticated user role).</p>

<p>There's some minimal help text up top explaining the grant values (Allow/Ignore/Deny), with a link to the module help page.  Below that, there are separate fieldsets for the global default and for each vocabulary.  The vocabularies are disabled by default.  </p>

<p>All grant columns use select boxes rather than the previous cryptic and bewildering radio buttons and checkboxes.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/3_role_config_enabled.png" /></p>

Enabling on a vocabulary

<p>When a user clicks the "enable" link for a given vocabulary, it loads new elements in that fieldset, with the configuration for the vocabulary default and a short help text explaining wtf the vocabulary default is.  The initial values are the same as the global default.  This change reduces the number of clicks to configure a vocabulary default and helps guide the user through the configuration.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/4_vocab_enabled.png" /></p>

Adding a term configuration

<p>Under "Term access rules," the user initially has two links: "add" and "add all."  The "add" link loads the options that were previously under "New" at the bottom of the grant table.  This does add one click to the configuration of a single term, but hopefully the reduced clicks elsewhere will make up for it.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/5_term_add.png" /></p>

<p>If the user clicks "add all," a similar form wil be loaded, but without the term selection box or the "with children" checkbox.</p>

<p>When the user clicks the "Add" button on this form, the term(s) are added with the selected option and the familiar block of term configurations appears:</p>

<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/6_terms.png" /></p>

<p>One possibility is to have a separate "delete selected" button in each vocabulary fieldset, either above or below the main term table.  Another option would be to use the pattern found on admin/content, but since these are separate fieldsets, that might be confusing and unexpected.</p>

Notes

<ul><li>Somewhere (probably at the very bottom of the form), there is a big "Save all" button.</li><li>It would be preferable to have all the various changes on the role configuration form happen in AJAXy fashion.</li><li>It would also be helpful for the color-changing "Changes not saved until form is submitted blah" thing to happen.  </li><li>Some jQuery to set initial values of new rows to the configured defaults currently in the form would be nice as well.</li><li>Sometime here I'll open <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/taxonomy_access">TAC issues</a> for the individual changes listed above.</li><li>I consider myself a backend developer, so if someone wants to submit patches to <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/taxonomy_access">TAC's issue queue</a> implementing part or all of this, that would be stellar!</li></ul>

                    This sounds awfully familiar        
        

<img src="http://www.lullabot.com/sites/lullabot.com/files/imagecache/190x190_rounded/images/entry/entry-image_module-monday.png" alt="" title="" hspace="10" align="right" width="190" height="190" /><p>The introduction of "entities" in Drupal 7 heralded a new era of flexibility and abstract nouns. The entity system allows existing Drupal data like comments, taxonomy terms, and user accounts to share much of the flexibility that nodes have long enjoyed, without forcing <em>every</em> type of data to adopt Node module's idiosyncrasies. Entities can use custom fields, but don't necessarily require robust content features like version tracking, translation support, and so on.</p>
<p>While programmers can define custom entities using their own modules, however, there's no way for site builders to create them from scratch. No way, that is, save the <em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/eck">Entity Construction Kit.</a></em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.lullabot.com/sites/lullabot.com/files/create-entity.png" class="fancy" alt="Screenshot of administration screen" /></p>
<p>The Entity Construction Kit gives site builders a central screen in the Structure administration area of the site where they can define new entity types. Each entity type can have several built-in properties like creation dates, a simple on/off status flag, so on. Each entity type can also have multiple bundles -- when testing, I created a "Muppet" entity type with "Monster" and "Normal" bundles. Like any other entity type, you can attach custom fields to them to store whatever data you'd like: the "simple properties" are managed automatically by the Entity Construction Kit.</p>  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>RESTful is the native API of web browsers. When you put some website&#8217;s address into a browser, that&#8217;s an implied REST expression called a &#8220;GET&#8221; of the resource at that address. In response to that GET request, the web server on the other end returns a web page. However, REST is much more than requesting the resource (data) at some address. Just like using any website, one is able to Create things, Retrieve them afterwards, perform Updates to them, and eventually Delete them. That Create -&gt; Retrieve -&gt; Update -&gt; Delete cycle is called &#8220;doing CRUD&#8221; (really), and that in a nutshell is what creating and using a RESTful system is all&nbsp;about. </p>
<p>In the &#8220;early days&#8221; of the Internet, when someone wanted to make a printer or some other machine programmatically communicate over the Internet, more complex systems with names like SOAP, XMLRPC and AMF were used to handle that communication. Then around the year 2000, a smart guy named Roy Fielding pointed out that the web itself was an API and these complex systems were not only a bother to create and work through, but needless because what they were offering was already built into the web&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>Now, Drupal is a content management framework whose essential purpose is to create a website of some sort. You are probably familiar with some websites including information from other websites, such as a Twitter feed or Facebook friend status. This including of other website&#8217;s information can be accomplished &#8220;the old, hard way&#8221; via scraping the page that normally shows this data, via SOAP/XMLRPC or that communicating of information can be accomplished &#8220;the new, shiny RESTful way&#8221; which takes less effort and by it&#8217;s nature is universally&nbsp;supported. </p>
<p>This is essentially machine-to-machine communications, and is how an iPhone/iPad/Android/game console/printer or virtually any other device communicates on the Internet. This is using&nbsp;REST.</p>

    <p>I just wanted to point out something that I use very frequently that allows me to sync websites that are on two separate servers. Rsync! Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a "quick check" algorithm that looks for files that have changed in size or in last-modified time. Its a fast and efficient way to merge two different code bases without having to use ftp or any diff program.</p>
<p>Using Rsync is simple. First to install rsync you can use the following commands.</p>

sudo apt-get install rsync
<p>
or</p>

yum install rsync

  <div class="feed-item-body">
     <p>The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/taxonomy_access">Taxonomy Access Control</a> module, affectionately known as "TAC," is probably Drupal's oldest access control module.  It <a href="http://drupal.org/node/10047">dates back to Drupal 4.5</a>, when the <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules--node--node.module/group/node_access/7">core node access system</a> was in its infancy.  TAC's <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/taxonomy_access.git/commit/ead20c91e1d3c119a1d5fc64948e50af02575dc1">first CVS commit</a> was on Halloween in 2004.  That's a lot of Drupal history.</p>
<p>By combining Drupal's flexible taxonomy system with a sophisticated permission inheritance scheme, TAC allows anything from very simple to very complicated access control configurations.  In fact, you can theoretically <a href="http://drupalcampwi.com/sessions/node-access-control-modules-and-how-you-can-replace-most-them-tac">replace most node access modules with TAC</a>. Unfortunately, this same flexibility results in usability and user interface challenges.  Frankly, the module is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/drupaltruth/status/101853774754234368">notoriously</a> difficult to understand and configure.</p>
<p>What follows is my attempt to dissect the problems I've identified with TAC's UX.</p>
Background information: TAC's admin screens
<ol><li><a href="#s1">admin/config</a></li>
<li><a href="#s2">admin/config/people/taxonomy_access</a></li>
<li><a href="#s3">admin/config/people/taxonomy_access/role/%/edit</a></li>
</ol>Screen 1: admin/config
<p>Following the much-improved <a href="http://drupal.org/node/549094">D7 IA standards</a>, TAC's configuration is at admin/config/people.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/tac_s1.png" /></p>
<p>(<a href="#admin-list">return to list</a>)</p>
Screen 2: admin/config/people/taxonomy_access
<p>The central TAC configuration screen has recently been updated to follow <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1146122">standard D7 interface patterns</a> and provide more specific link text.</p>
Old screen
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/tac_s2_old.png" /></p>
Updated screen
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/tac_s2.png" /></p>
<p>(<a href="#admin-list">return to list</a>)</p>
Screen 3: admin/config/people/taxonomy_access/role/%/edit
<p>This is the truly problematic part of TAC's UI.  Originally, it provided no instruction whatsoever to the user.  After I took over TAC's maintenance in Drupal 6, I tried to ameliorate this by adding some help text in the form footer.  This help text definitely reduced the number of support requests filed in TAC's queue, but it's far from perfect.</p>
Main form
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/tac_s3_top.png" /></p>
Form footer     
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/tac_s3_bottom.png" /></p>
<p>(<a href="#admin-list">return to list</a>)</p>
UI Problems (and a few possible solutions)
Identified UI issues
<ol><li><a href="#problem-1">Enabled or disabled?</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-2">A? I? D? WTF?</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-3">Too many buttons</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-4">Accessibility violation: Form elements in table without individual labels</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-5"><em>Add tag</em> and <em>View tag</em> often overlooked</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-6">Global default overlooked or misunderstood</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-7">Vocabulary default overlooked or misunderstood</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-8">Too many options in term selection box</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-9">Broken hierarchy in term selection box</a></li>
<li><a href="#problem-10">Others?</a></li>
</ol>#1: Enabled or disabled?
<p>On the central TAC administration screen, it is not immediately clear which roles are enabled or disabled, or what this means.  Also, it might not be apparent that the anonymous and authenticated roles cannot be disabled.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/enabled_disabled.png" /></p>
Possible solutions:
<ol><li>Should there be a middle <em>Status</em> column indicating whether access control is enabled or disabled for the given role?</li>
<li>Should the enable and disable operations have separate columns?  Only one can appear for a role at a time.</li>
<li>Or, should the <em>Status</em> column mentioned above have a link (or form element) to enable/disable? </li>
<li>Or, would it be better to use draggable tables like the core block interface with <em>Enabled</em> and <em>Disabled </em>control columns/subheaders<em>?</em></li>
<li>Should there be text in the column for <em>edit access rules</em> when the role is disabled, or is it okay to leave it blank?</li>
</ol><p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#2: A? I? D? WTF?
<p>There are three possible values for each term grant: <em>Allow</em>, <em>Ignore</em>, or <em>Deny</em>.  On the admin form, these were historically labeled with merely A, I, and D, in order (one presumes) to save space, since the table already has six columns across.  This particular quirk of the TAC UI has resulted in the module being called "unusable" and "<a href="http://drupal.org/node/712402">incomprehensible</a>."</p>
<p>When I started maintaining TAC, I added two features to try to fix this problem: an &lt;acronym&gt; tag around the A/I/D labels, and the documentation in the footer section of the form as illustrated above.  However, neither of these fixes really resolve the core UX issues with these labels.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/aid.png" /></p>
Possible solution
<p>At <a href="http://drupalcampwi.com">DrupalCampWI 2011</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/712130">Patrick Rogne</a> made a great suggestion for how to fix this problem: Instead of radio buttons, use a select box for each of <em>View</em>, <em>Update</em>, and <em>Delete</em>, each with the full names of the grant values (<em>Allow</em>, <em>Ignore</em>, <em>Deny</em>).  Something like:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/select.png" /></p>
<p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#3: Too many buttons
<p>On a site with a lot of TAC access control rules, the form quickly gets pretty overwhelming.  Screens like this are what scared me away from TAC back in Drupal 4.7 days:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/too_manu_buttons.png" /></p>

<ol><li>The switch from radios to select boxes described in <a href="#problem-2">#2</a> would help with this issue.</li>
<li>It might also help to separate each vocabulary into its own fieldset or separate table, something like:<img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/separate_vocabs.png" /></li>
<li>Other suggestions?</li>
</ol><p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#4: Accessibility violation: Form elements in table without individual labels
<p>As above.  This clear accessibility violation is another of the reasons I originally avoided TAC.  It's challenging to fix because of the information density of the form.</p>
Possible solutions
<ol><li>The change suggested in<a href="#problem-2"> #2</a> would (again) help with this problem, by providing meaningul form element text.</li>
<li>Would it be appropriate to add form labels inline inside each table cell, and hide them in graphical browsers using CSS techniques?</li>
<li>Other suggestions?</li>
</ol><p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#5: <em>Add tag</em> and <em>View tag</em> often overlooked or misunderstood
<p>Many people configure the <em>Add tag</em> and <em>View tag </em>permissions incorrectly (or may not even notice these options are there).  This leads to a lot of support issues opened as "bug reports" because users do not understand the design behavior of these permissions.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/add_view.png" /></p>
Possible solution
<p>It might help to convert the <em>Add tag</em> and <em>View tag </em>elements to select boxes (as suggested in <a href="#problem-2">#2</a> for <em>View/Update/Delete</em>).  This would make them more obvious and provide a consistent interface pattern.  However, there are a couple issues with this:</p>
<ul><li>This would take up more horizontal space and might not fit in a standard 960px overlay.</li>
<li>Unlike <em>View/Update/Delete</em>, <em>Add tag</em> and <em>View tag</em> can only be on or off (maybe <em>Allow</em> or <em>Deny</em>).</li>
<li>While <em>View/Update/Delete</em> control access to nodes, <em>Add tag</em> and <em>View tag</em> control access to terms themselves.  Should the UI then be different for them?</li>
</ul><p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#6: Global default overlooked or misunderstood
<p>Issues are often filed because users misunderstand the purpose of the global default.  (It applies to both nodes with no taxonomy terms, and taxonomy terms that have not specifically been configured.)</p>
Possible solutions
<ol><li>Separating the global default configuration from other vocabularies as described in #3 might help make it more obvious.</li>
<li>Inline help text explaining what the global default is for might help.</li>
<li>Perhaps there also be a way to prompt users to configure the global defaults for the anonymous and authenticated roles immediately when they install the module.  Suggestions?</li>
<li>Other suggestions?</li>
</ol><p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#7: Vocabulary default overlooked or misunderstood
<p>The vocabulary default is used for all terms in that vocabulary that don't have a specific configuration.  It is option and is added by selecting it from the term selection box under <em>New</em>.  Users often overlook it or misunderstand its purpose</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/selecting_default.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/configuring_default.png" /></p>
Possible solutions
<ol><li>Separating each vocabulary into its own fieldset (as described in <a href="#problem-3">#3</a>) might help.</li>
<li>Maybe the vocabulary default should no longer be optional, but instead start out the same as the global default.  This would be functionally the same except that it would result in a few more grant records being written, but it would reduce confusion.</li>
<li>Another possibility, compatible with the first two, would be to have each vocabulary disabled by default.  The user would click enable and then be presented with the vocabulary default.  Only then would he or she be able to configure specific terms in the vocabulary.  There is an existing issue for this (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/925166">#925166</a>) but the patch needs work and it is an incomplete solution by itself.</li>
<li>Other suggestions?</li>
</ol><p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#8: Too many options in term selection box
<p>By default, all the taxonomy terms on the site are listed in the "New" term selection box.  This is, obviously, completely unusable on a site with a large taxonomy.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" typeof="Image" src="http://xjm.drupalgardens.com/sites/xjm.drupalgardens.com/files/term_select_box.png" /></p>
Possible solutions
<p>Everything described in <a href="#problem-7">#7</a> would also help with this.  With those changes, each vocabulary would have its own select box, and the select box would only appear for vocabularies enabled by the user.</p>
<p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#9: Broken hierarchy in term selection box
<p>When terms are added to the configuration for the role, they are removed from the term selection box.  This results in confusing, broken term hierarchies when some (but not all) terms in a vocabulary are selected.</p>
Possible solutions
<p>?</p>
<p>(<a href="#problem-list">return to list</a>)</p>
#10: Others?
<p>Do you recognize any other problems with the interface?  Have any other suggestions on how it can be improved?  Please let me know!</p>
Conclusion
<p>I'd love to hear any feedback you have on the problems and solutions above, or any other ideas you have for improving the user interface.  I'd love patches even more!</p>
<p>Once I have some good working guidelines on what TAC's UI should be like, I can open some issues in the module's <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/taxonomy_access">issue queue</a> with specific tasks, to make it easier for others to contribute.  If you want to help make TAC's interface better but can't contribute UI ideas or code, you can also offer sponsorship to help.  I'd love it if TAC had a better UX, but since I already understand how the darn module works, it's unfortunately "not my itch" to fix it, so anything you can do to help is appreciated. ;-)</p>
