    <p>I would like to introduce new module <a href="http://drupal.org/project/search_api_solr">Search API Location</a> that provides possibility to do spatial search using Apachesolr.</p>
<p>At the moment we can search by radius on the map putting the center of the circle. You are welcome to test on <a href="http://ygerasimov.com/geo/search_location">Demo site</a>.</p>
<p>Technical details<br />
Search API Solr module is used for integration with Solr. Search API Location module exports location data to Search API via hook_entity_property_info_alter().</p>
<p>Apachesolr itself uses LocalSolr library that should be compiled into apachesolr. You can follow instructions in README to compile apachesolr or download ready apachesolr from <a href="http://ygerasimov.com/geo">demo site</a>.</p>
<p>Demo site Location Search is built as a view. Search API Location module provides exposed filter for radius with slider.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy and welcome to participate in development of spatial search functionality for drupal.</p>

    <p>I've seen a few posts around Drupal.org from people trying to figure out a solid way to use Git to effectively manage their Drupal installation. This is the method that I've been using.</p>



Initial repository setup

<p>To start off, open a terminal and run these commands (you can copy/paste if you want):</p>

git init
touch README
git add README
git commit -a -m &quot;Initial commit&quot;

<p>Now, we'll set up the Core remote and fetch Core's history:</p>

git remote add core git://drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git 
git fetch core

Getting the current code

<p>Since we've pulled in all of Core's history, we just need to merge a given commit into our current branch. To do that, we'll go look at the <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git">repository browser</a> for Drupal Core. Right below the shortlog, there's a section titled "tags":</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111014-gctmngsnbtuei4h6jia4ps6eyr.jpg" alt="Tags" /></p>

<p>Find the tag you want to work off of, and click the "commit" link. In this case, I'll be using 7.8.</p>

<p>This will take you to the commit browser. Copy the commit hash (we'll need it in just a second):</p>

<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111014-g8wcb1aic4se3yjae1325fuijb.jpg" alt="Commit" /></p>

<p>Go back to your terminal and run this command (replace the commit hash with the one you just copied from Gitweb):</p>

git merge 6b54665a5921d26d00559644754047420776da4a

<p>This will merge the 7.8 commit into your current master branch.</p>

Working on your project

<p>You can work on your project as you normally would. Add your own remote (if you want):</p>

git remote add origin git@github.com:cweagans/testproject.git 

<p>And you can push master there as well:</p>

git push origin master

<p><strong>Caveat</strong>: If another developer clones from your Github repository, and that developer wants to merge core commits, they will have to run the following commands first:</p>

git remote add core git://drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git 
git fetch core

Upgrading core

<p>After you've worked on a project for a while, it's inevitable that you'll have to upgrade core. It's super easy (you'll have to have the core remote set up in your repo first):</p>

git fetch core 
git merge &#91;new commit hash&#93;

<p>If anybody has ideas for improvement on this system, I'd love to hear about them in the comments!</p>

  </h3>

      <a href="/aggregator/sources/1" class="feed-item-source">Ultimas noticias do drupal</a> -
      <span class="feed-item-date">sex, 14/10/2011 - 14:00</span>
  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>I recently went to the <a href="http://underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/">Brand New Conference</a>, a one-day gathering of designers to discuss branding, identity and ideation. The list of speakers included designers from notable design studios and ad agencies from all over the world, including Australia, Peru, Canada and the United States. As we expand our branding offerings at Chapter Three, these issues are increasingly relevant, so I’d like to share some of the more interesting bits from the day.</p>
<p>The common thread throughout all of the talks was the notion that branding is about telling a story. Stories help an audience to engage with the content and relate to the brand’s personality, rather than the brand shouting at them with a wall of information.</p>
<p>As presenters discussed case studies of their work and revealed secrets of their process, many chose to work with a simple mark and take advantage of collateral and context to create the personality surrounding a brand. Vince Frost, of <a href="http://www.frostdesign.com.au/">Frost Design</a>, uses clever wordplay and simple typography to create a foundation and allows other brand components to play off of that.</p>
<p>Marina Willard, of <a href="http://www.wolffolins.com/">Wolff Olins</a>, believes that brands are a promise, and emphasized playfulness and participation with the audience. In a creative process, ideas are the intersection of “what the world needs” and “what is special about you”. She emphasized the value of the individual designer, saying that without bringing something unique to problem solving, everyone’s solutions would look identical and be uninteresting.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.chapterthree.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/500px_wide/marina_willard.jpg" alt="" title="" class="imagecache-500px_wide" /></p>
<p>Christopher Simmons, of <a href="http://www.minesf.com/">Mine</a>, spent his time discussing one case study in depth, including all of his process. Like Willard’s diagram, Simmons believes that a brand position is “focused where the concerns of the target audiences intersect with the concerns of the client and context.”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.chapterthree.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/500px_wide/simmons_brand.jpg" alt="" title="" class="imagecache-500px_wide" /></p>
<p>He showed work for <a href="http://www.bunmee.co/">Bun Mee</a>, a local Vietnamese sandwich shop, which included logo, menu, website, interior design and storefront. Much of the work, like interior design and handcrafting a large wooden menu board, wasn’t in the original scope but was organically absorbed as he engaged with the project. The result is a more cohesive experience in which a small team was able to create a culture for both the flat collateral and physical space. It’s a rare instance when this is possible, and taking on out of scope elements is a dangerous game, but Simmons demonstrated a real success.</p>
<p>Everything presented at the conference made it clear that a traditional approach is often no longer appropriate or effective. Though very little web or interactive work was shown, these are issues that are tangential to the work we do.

<p>Drupal is a powerful content management system. I sometimes joke with clients that I&#39;ve used every CMS out there but I landed on Drupal because of its flexibility and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esEcwAWi6dk" target="_blank">power</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is, I&#39;m an opportunist; I pull together a suite of solutions based on budget and requirements. Sometimes I may do everything in Drupal. Sometimes, however, I may pull in a different solution even though Drupal could do it too. I use Drupal as the foundation, but other products can be integrated.</p>
<p>I think everyone should try working this way. <strong>Don&#39;t spend hours and hours to get Drupal to do something when there is a great product right next to you.</strong></p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>Continuing on from yesterday's post on <a href="http://www.designtotheme.com/blog/base-themes">Base Themes for Drupal</a>, let's jump into the process of how I build a theme.</p>
<dl>
<dt>1. Communicate with your whole team.</dt>
<dd>If you're a team of one this is easier, but chances are you have at least a graphic designer, site builder/developer and a client on your team. It's really important to know what's most important to each of these stakeholders. Make sure you know <em>their</em> priorities for the finished theme.</dd>
<dt>2. Plan your data structure.</dt>
<dd>Get your data model right and theming is easy. But if you don't get it right you'll tear your hair trying to break content into smaller components so it can be shuffled into the right place.</dd>
<dt>3. Use wire frames to prove what you're saying about how the site ought to be built.</dt>
<dd>I used to think that wire frames were just an extra step that you could bill the client for. That's because I was able to see the site in my head. Now I use wire frames as proof that my ideas are right. If I can wire frame the output, and know how Drupal will create the output, I know it's time to move on to the next. As a bonus: I can use the wire frames as mini checklists when I do work on the site to ensure I haven't missed anything.</dd>
<dt>4. Build the site (ignore the theme).</dt>
<dd>This is where you find out if your data model really is right. You can start putting in real content wherever possible. And you can encourage the client to input the content for you so they start to familiarize themselves with the administrative interface. You may find unexpected problems--now is the right time to find these problems. It's still early enough that you can make changes without feeling you've wasted too much time.</dd>
<dt>5. Convert your wire frame to its grid layout.</dt>
<dd>Add notes to your wire frames saying how many grid columns each of those shapes represents. I find it easier to scribble on the wire frames than the finished PSD files as they're already more "loose" and "sketchy" than the polished design files.</dd>
<dt>6. Create a minimum viable theme.</dt>
<dd>Using the PSD and the wire frames as a reference, build out the HTML fragments in the relevant tpl.php files. Substitute CSS effects for PSD effects where possible. (More about this next time.)</dd>
<dt>7. Apply your theme to the site.</dt>
<dd>Yup, upload your unfinished theme to a development or staging server and see how it looks.</dd>
<dt>8. Refine as necessary based on the UX.</dt>
<dd>Using your wire frames as a reference, fix the theme. Then walk through the site as if you were a visitor and fix the "unexpected" pages (and navigation if necessary).</dd>
</dl>
<p>And there you have it: the steps I use to create a theme. As you can see I do a lot of planning and then get the theme onto the site as fast as I can.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see me walk through each of these steps for a real theme, check out my  Acquia webinar PSD to Drupal Theme. You can <a href="http://acquia.com/resources/acquia-tv/conference/psd-drupal-theme-0">watch it here</a>.

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>It has been a while since I've posted an update on localize.drupal.org services for various reasons. I greatly hoped that our Google Summer of Code project for activity tracking <a href="http://localize.drupal.org/node/3329">announced with big fanfare in May</a> goes through well, but unfortunately my student dropped out from the program lacking time due to family reasons and did not make useful progress to roll out improvements.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://buytaert.net/multilingual-support-in-drupal-8">Dries selected me</a> to lead an effort to dramatically improve language support in Drupal core for Drupal 8 and that has a scope way beyond just software translation. We did a pretty good job of providing tools for software translations so far with localize.drupal.org, l10n_update and l10n_client modules, but for Drupal 8, the focus is to bring complete core features and more usability to these and content and configuration translation alike. It is very exciting and going to bring Drupal to a whole new level where language support is needed! To follow that effort, see the video and mindmap at <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1260534" title="http://drupal.org/node/1260534">http://drupal.org/node/1260534</a>. It is a huge undertaking and it required me to dramatically dial down my focus on localize.drupal.org improvements.</p>
<p>However, in the meantime, our <a href="http://drupal.org/node/589774">misterious problems with some packages being partially parsed</a> did not solve themselves, and we could not figure out the real reasons, so Zoltán Balogh got tired enough of the problem that he <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1267466">coded a workaround</a> for every team manager to be able to request a release to reset itself and parsed again. That was just rolled out, so now every translation community manager should be able to see a <em>Start over</em> link on project release lists, with which you can request for a broken parsed release to be parsed again. Because our release parsing problems are transient, this should get you back a fully parsed release pretty soon afterwards.</p>
<p>There is also continued interest to set up new teams on the site, I've just added Oriya, Lao, Azerbaijani and Tamil (Sri Lanka) to the list of languages, which is now just one shy of a hundred (not counting our test language playground). That is an amazing number! Get ready to pop your champagnes! Who is going to be number 100?</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/993752">Dashamir Hoxha</a> did a stellar job to come in fresh to the Drupal community and update such a huge module as the Localization server module to Drupal 7! Yes! It passes all tests (although the test suite does not cover all of the functionality, it does cover all the basics and a sizable part of what localize.drupal.org needs). It would need more work, but we are a lot closer to be able to update localize.drupal.org to Drupal 7 in the future.</p>
<p>Now with all this while there are very nice prospects for localize.drupal.org, I will likely not be able to dedicate a good amount of time to the site, so I decided to post a public call for help instead, while I still have resources to help mentor people who would like to contribute and possibly eventually take over maintenance and improvement of the site. For a long time, localize.drupal.org was the posterchild of great improvements on drupal.org, now that <a href="http://randyfay.com/node/113">all the awesome improvements are going on on drupal.org</a> we should not leave localize.drupal.org behind either. Are you interested in working on gradual improvements? Porting the site to Drupal 7 (og, messaging and notifications and all that)? Comment and let's see how I can help you help Drupal!</p>

<p>There have been recent discussions about the maintainability and sustainability of Drupal core. They highlighted a significant lack in the number of skilled Drupal contributors. So the question is: how can we improve the quality of contributions and increase the quantity of skilled contributors?</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>The purpose of this post is to describe the solution that, after careful consideration, seems best suited to alleviating the situation described in the <a href="/the-woes-of-the-testbot">previous post</a>. Other solutions may exist that we have not considered and that will effectively solve the problem. We are open to discussing alternatives and welcome constructive comments on our proposal. At the same time, we discourage negative comments that do not offer a positive alternative. As it is clear the current situation needs improvement, simply dismissing our proposal without offering a better alternative is not useful.</p>
Proposal
<p><a href="http://reviewdriven.com/">ReviewDriven</a> (RD) is a distributed quality assurance platform built to provide a simple yet powerful interface that makes it easy to apply the best practices of continuous integration, test driven development, and automated quality reviews to your development life cycle. The ReviewDriven stack provides a completely rebuilt system designed to take advantage of Drupal 7 and contributed modules that will allow Drupal.org, Drupal development shops, and site owners to take advantage of automated quality assurance. In Drupal terms, RD is the next generation of the testbot (<a href="http://qa.drupal.org/">qa.drupal.org</a>).</p>
<p>We would like to see DO and other interested parties take advantage of automated QA tools. Towards that end, we propose that DO engage RD to assume the role of the testbot and provide those same services to the Drupal community.</p>
Advantages

<a href="/sites/blog.boombatower.com/files/workflow_0.png"><img src="/sites/blog.boombatower.com/files/workflow_0.png" alt="" /></a>

<p>One of the limitations of the current system and one of the primary concerns we addressed with RD is the lack of control over the testing workflow. For example, the current workflow settings apply globally instead of on a more granular basis. In contrast, the RD platform will allow Drupal.org full control to define the workflow and settings to be used with each review. <strong>The integration between the testbot (RD) and Drupal.org will continue to be maintained as an open source module</strong> which will allow anyone to contribute ideas and changes to the QA workflow on Drupal.org. Since the ReviewDriven stack provides a versioned API, the Drupal.org integration may be maintained and updated independent of RD and on it's own schedule. <strong>This approach leaves all the control and flexibility in the hands of the Drupal community and shifts the burden of the testbot to RD.</strong></p>
<p>Other challenges faced by the current system were also taken into consideration when building ReviewDriven. The ReviewDriven stack is extremely flexible which in itself solves a number of the current issues and opens up a variety of new options. This opens up the possibility of reviews for things like Coder and code coverage.</p>
<p>The RD stack as a whole is much more maintainable since it is built on as many contributed modules as possible. This keeps the actual codebase much smaller then the current system (PIFR). Depending on contributed modules has led us to suggest and contribute a number of improvements to those modules, and to create other contributed modules. This also implies the system is easily maintainable by the Drupal community in the event we open source the code (since the majority of the code is already maintained by others). The RD architecture is analogous to any other Drupal site (sponsored by a good citizen) in that we are maintaining the code specific to our site while contributing back to the community modifications to existing modules and new features designed as generic modules.</p>
Putting QA in context

<a href="/sites/blog.boombatower.com/files/house.png"><img src="/sites/blog.boombatower.com/files/house.png" alt="Using a house as illustration for building a site on Drupal" /></a>

<p>Our proposal hinges on the fact that the testbot (and most of Drupal.org) provides a direct benefit to everyone but, just like roads and other infrastructure, the cost needs to be shared. Core and contributed modules provide a direct benefit in an indirect way by reducing the amount of and time spent writing custom code, ensuring the base system works as intended, and allowing you to leverage with confidence that code base while building your site. Core and contributed modules represent the sure foundation upon which you build your house.</p>
<p>There has been plenty of discussion about the important role the testing infrastructure and testing as a whole played in Drupal 7 development. The benefit of QA is also evident by the fact that a number of very large Drupal sites launched on Drupal 7 before it was officially released. The stability and dependability offered by quality assurance testing is something everyone wants.</p>
<p>Drupal.org is one of very few open source projects, much less projects in general, to adopt quality assurance and testing. The Drupal core development process requires new features to have tests and bug fixes to include tests. This workflow is encouraged for contributed projects and has been adopted by many of the more used projects among others. Not only does this help ensure the stability and quality of Drupal and its contributed projects, but in turn serves as a selling point and differentiator for Drupal adoption. Given that QA is both an adoption point and a vital tool for improving Drupal, does it not follow that it makes sense to provide funding for a full-time effort towards its improvement?</p>
<p>Just as many Linux developers are full-time employees paid to work on improving Linux, we seek to work full-time on improving the Drupal ecosystem through quality assurance. We are not the first to be funded full-time to work on Drupal or to be paid to improve Drupal.org. A perfect example is <a href="http://drupal.org/user/24967">Angie Byron (webchick)</a> who was <a href="http://webchick.net/hook-career-alter">hired by Acquia to work full time on Drupal</a>. Just as Linux was started by hobbyists and grew into a profession, so too Drupal appears to have outgown the ability to be maintained entirely by volunteers.</p>
Funding
<p>We see two separate areas that need funding. The first focuses on taking advantage of the ReviewDriven platform by updating the Drupal.org integration with the new testbot (RD). The second area is the ongoing fee for use of the platform (which includes infrastructure costs). RD will use the ongoing fees to improve and maintain the platform (like any other business).</p>
<p>Harnessing the flexibility provided by ReviewDriven will require a large overhaul of the current Drupal.org QA integration module (PIFT). We envision Drupal taking advantage of the granular settings supported by RD to provide per project, per release, per issue, and per patch settings to control the reviews made. Granular settings will ensure that the various workflows, coding standards, and environments that exist in "contrib" can be handled properly. Many projects have different requirements or adhere to different standards between their various releases. The integration with the new testbot would remain open source as Drupal.org integration and can be funded just like any other Drupal.org project.</p>
<p>We would also like to see a QA status advertised on each project page, possibly even some sort of ranking based on a number of quality assurance metrics. These metrics would help people select between similarly featured modules, advertise that we do QA, and help motivate developers to adopt QA. We have many other ideas for improvements and anticipate suggestions from the community.</p>
<p>The ongoing service also requires ongoing funding to handle infrastructure costs, feature improvements, updates for Drupal core changes, and requests from the Drupal community would ensure that things do not stagnate. We have a vision for new features that would significantly improve the Drupal ecosystem, some of which we have discussed with a few community members.</p>
<p>We envision either the Drupal Association or a group of businesses and other organizations with an interest in Drupal to hire RD as the logical successor to the current testbot. Our business will be to develop and maintain the testbot for use by Drupal.org and other organizations. The same approach can then be applied to other critical peices of infrastructure such as the improvement of Drupal.org and its maintenance. We would like to pioneer this effort for Drupal to further enhance the process and tools available to Drupal contributors and the community.</p>
<p>Further details about the specifics of the arrangement, details of the improvements, and plans for the future can be found in our formal <a href="http://reviewdriven.com/proposal/drupal-qa-proposal.pdf">proposal</a> and <a href="http://reviewdriven.com/proposal/drupal-qa-proposal-addendum.pdf">addendum</a>.</p>
What to expect during the transition
<p>With both the short-term upgrades and improvements to the Drupal.org integration and the ongoing RD services funded, we see the transition to RD taking shape as follows.</p>
<p>The first stage of the transition will require the update of Drupal.org's integration with the testbot to provide basic connectivity with ReviewDriven. Supporting RD will require a number of changes, both user-facing and behind the scenes. In addition, just using the ReviewDriven platform will enable a number of features and workflows.</p>
<p>Once the initial integration is ready to be tested in production, we suggest both ReviewDriven and the predecessor be run in parallel. Running both systems in parallel will provide the community with a preview of what is to come and an opportunity for feedback. Results from the two systems can be compared to provide a final round of human checks and give people time to adjust to the new system. After the completion of the parallel phase the old testbot will be deactivated and the new system will be given priority.</p>
<p>The second phase involves the larger changes necessary to take advantage of ReviewDriven's features and flexibility. We will start discussions and work on this phase as the initial integration stabilizes.</p>
<p>Some of the exciting features we will expose to DO in one or both of the stages include:</p>

<a href="/sites/blog.boombatower.com/files/coverage.png"><img src="/sites/blog.boombatower.com/files/coverage.png" alt="Code coverage example" /></a><br />
Example of code coverage during a test run<br />
green = executed, red = not executed, gray = ignored (or non-executable)

<ul>
<li>Much improved turnaround time with the ability to scale as the test suite grows</li>
<li>Code coverage reports from test runs [picture]</li>
<li>Testing of sandboxes (both core forks and modules)</li>
<li>Support for the developer application process</li>
<li>Drush make scripts for retrieving third party libraries.</li>
<li>Drush make files in lieu of parsing the project dependencies</li>
<li>Execution of arbitrary commands during various stages of the worker processing</li>
<li>Automatic enabling of issue retesting</li>
<li>Completely automated site reviews (reviews run against a configured site)</li>
<li>Reroll of a patch (using git --rebase) on one issue after a commit on another issue (for example, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/22336">this large core change</a>)</li>
<li>Display of quality metrics</li>
<li>Visible branch test results</li>
<li>Forcing a patch to run when a branch is broken (in order to fix the branch)</li>
<li>Determine the disruption to other patches that would be caused by another patch (e.g. the patch to move all core files)</li>
<li>Run Selenium tests</li>
<li>Provide separation between the testbot and the Drupal installer by writing a special script maintained by the community</li>
</ul>
Conclusion
<p>We look forward to feedback about our proposal and encourage you to voice your opinion. Please be sure to be constructive. In case its not obvious, we are extremely passionate about doing this. So let's make this happen.</p>

          <p>The Drupal community is awesome, but is only one part of the larger open source community.  There are plenty of great speakers that the Drupal community could benefit from seeing speak, if only we could get them to DrupalCon.</p>
<p>So we're going to try and get them to DrupalCon.</p>
<p>We would like to reach out to luminaries outside the Drupal world to invite them to come speak.  Not just keynotes, but other influential developers, designers, and business people.</p>
<p>There are many to choose from, so we're asking for your suggestions.  Know a non-Drupal PHP developer that is simply amazing?  Would we benefit from a hard-core node.js session?  Any HTML5 wizards or design gurus that simply blow you away?</p>
<p>Let us know in the comments who would be a good candidate to reach out to.  We'll take the suggestions in this thread and reach out to potential speakers.</p>
<p>Let's make DrupalCon not just the premiere Drupal conference, but the premiere web developer conference.</p>

    <p>There's an industry-wide trend for service providers on the Internet. As solutions are discovered, they're then standardized, commoditized and automated, after which the hot-zone for innovation shifts to building on top of whatever problem just got solved. We like to call this "moving up the stack." It's awesome.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://getpantheon.com/sites/getpantheon.com/files/up_the_stack.gif" alt="Moving up the stack" />

<strong>Humans Belong At The Top Of The Stack</strong>

</p><p>If something can be automated, it's probably not a good thing for human beings to be doing: as a species we excel at creativity, problem-solving, non-linear thinking and communication. Repetitive or rote tasks — particularly those with high complexity and low tolerance for error — are physically and mentally crushing for people, and really much better done by robots.</p>

<p>Is a message we've taken to heart at Pantheon. We want to put you, the human being, the developer, the site owner, at the very top of the stack. Because that's where you belong. The stuff below you is, well, beneath you. </p>

<p>In telling this story, we get asked some interesting questions. Are we a platform? Are we software-as-a-service? We have an interesting answer. Our thesis is that we can provide enormous value by combining the best of both worlds.</p>

<strong>The Platform Model</strong>

<p>One great company we get asked about frequently is PHPFog, or as it's soon to be known, "appfog":</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://getpantheon.com/sites/getpantheon.com/files/appfog.gif" alt="PHP Fog, nee App Fog" />
</p>

<p>In this case, the service being provided is a ready-to-go runtime: a working application environment (for PHP, Ruby, Python), usually tuned for performance and the ability to scale, and often bundled with some additional services like a database.</p>

<p>This is awesome if you are a web software developer, but let's be clear: on-demand runtimes do not provide solutions to use cases. These can be great tools for custom web app development, amazing even, but website solutions they are not. The real value for customers is what gets created or stacked on top of these platforms. With Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, VMWare and others getting into this game, the underlying platforms are on their way to being commiditized for software developers. Innovation is going to move up.</p>

<strong>The SaaS Model</strong>

<p>The most common pattern you see that builds above the Platform level is the Software as a Service ("SaaS") model. This is where providers build all the way up the stack into a one-size-fits-all solution:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://getpantheon.com/sites/getpantheon.com/files/squarespace.gif" alt="SquareSpace SaaS" />
</p>

<p>Website services like <a href="http://weebly.com">Weebly</a> and <a href="http://squarespace.com">SquareSpace</a> have spent a lot of time crafting their products, and for use cases like blogging, a portfolio or personal websites these are great options. You can get started quickly, see value, and don't need a professional developer. The downside is that your functionality is limited to what the SaaS development team chooses to give you. For organizations that don't work in whatever mold is delievered, it's a bad fit with no flexibility.</p>

<p>In the Drupal world, this would be like offering one-click Drupal installs with no ability to upload your own modules, use your own theme, or otherwise leverage the 50,000-strong developer community and contributed code space. Not very compelling. Drupal needs additional functionality — e.g. a good install profile — in order to really work as a pure SaaS service.</p>

<strong>Pantheon: The Best of Both Worlds</strong>

<p>We believe there is a better way. With Pantheon, you'll get the best of both worlds: the flexibility and power of Open Source and the Drupal community, combined with the stability and ease of use of Software as a Service:</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://getpantheon.com/sites/getpantheon.com/files/pantheon.png" alt="The Pantheon Way" />
</p>

<p>We're doing something different, and we're able to do it in part because Drupal is special, both in terms of what it does, and also in terms of how the ecosystem works around it.</p>

<p>On the technology side, we believe the long-running debate of "is it a framework or is it an application?" is actually one of Drupal's greatest assets. It's both! That's a good thing. The web isn't a "one size fits all" sort of place, and this combination of solid architecture with robust flexibility is key to the future of the project.</p>

<p>On the human side, you have the incredible Drupal community delivering <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/drupal-contributions">enormous amounts of value</a> to the project all the time. It's amazing what people do <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrys/2329243533/">for the love of Drupal</a>, and the functionality available in contrib will continue to outpace even the best in-house closed-source engineering teams.</p>

<p>But also this isn't  just a community of hobbyists and self-itch-scratchers: there's a thriving and growing business ecosystem around the platform. There are literally thousands of firms that "do Drupal" now, many of them with deep expertise. There are tens of thousands of qualified, competent freelancers who <a href="https://www.odesk.com/trends/Drupal">pay their rent</a> every month with Drupal-based work. Thats huge: since we're not in a "one size fits all" world, serious projects need professional attention to be successful.</p>

<p>There's really no other project out there that combines these strengths: a solid technology foundation featuring the best of both a framework and a product, built by a dynamic open-source community, and brought to market via a thriving business ecosystem. That's the trifecta, the hat-trick, the trinity. Hard to beat.</p>

<p>Obviously Drupal is already a huge success, but at Pantheon we think it can go much much further. We think this recipe will be the basis for a whole new industry and nothing less than a renaissance on the web. </p>

<p>The missing piece, we think, is a solid delivery system that can put the humans back at the top of the stack. It needs to work for developers of new tools and techniques, owners of customer sites, end-users of productized "applications"; and take the friction out of development, deployment and long term maintenance.</p>

<p>That's Pantheon. That's what we're setting out to create. We hope you all enjoy it!</p>  </div>

    <p>As you know, I've been writing and talking and thinking about burnout lately.</p>
<p>One of the key causes of burnout is the situation where <strong>we lack control over what we do</strong>.</p>
<p>For a long time, it seemed impossible to move Drupal.org (or our workflow or methodologies) forward. It just seemed like we were stuck with what we had.  We lacked control over our website and our community processes.<br />
Recently, though we've come light-years from the old ways. Incredible improvements to longstanding problem areas like the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1306444">Follow! Instead of subscribe comments</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/424400">Deployment of BUEditor on d.o</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/648218">API Change Notices</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1036132">Issue summaries</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1241704">testing contrib projects with dependencies</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/528682">Images for all on drupal.org</a> demonstrate that we <em>do</em> have control of our work environment and our territory. What great news! In addition, progress in the docs team toward a more sustainable strategy (with curated and uncurated docs) is a huge step forward.</p>
<p>The improvement of Drupal processes and d.o features can and will go a long way toward improving the health of our community and avoiding burnout.  Congratulations to all who have led this sea-change in how our community works.</p>
