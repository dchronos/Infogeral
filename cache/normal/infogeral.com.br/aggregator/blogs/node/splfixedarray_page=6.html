    <p><img src="http://wiredcraft.com/sites/default/files/y-u-no-like-wysiwyg.png" alt="Y U NO LIKE WYSIWYG?" /></p>

<p>A few years back, I would probably have not thought twice about this; shipping a site with a WYSIWYG editor seemed then as natural as ensuring Google Analytics is set. It was a feature that many clients would just assume you'd add. Over the past few years however, I and my colleagues grew tired of WYSIWYG editors; mentioning TinyMCE or CKEditor would probably earn you a squint of disapproval from the team.</p>



What's our grief with WYSIWYG editors?

<p>First, I'd like to acknowledge that these editors are, for most, great pieces of software; they integrate in a wide range of projects, "get the job done" (depending on your interpretation of what "done" is) and really ease the adoption process with a certain type of audience. They offer an overwhelming volume of extensions and settings which can really cater to the most bizarre use cases.</p>

<p>That being said, we see some of these strengths as issues;</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ease of adoption</strong> is usually the biggest reason invoked for using these editors; "We don't have time to train people to write for the Web, provide them with an interface as close as possible to their beloved Microsoft Word and they'll be set". Except we don't think letting people bring their regular word processor habits online is that great of an idea. The Web is a medium of its own, with specific constraints and capabilities; you do not think of layout, semantic or media in the same way as you do for, say, print.</li>
<li><strong>Feature-rich</strong>; oh the intoxicating power of adding every single feature the client ask for. Want to have buttons to add pictures, form elements, special characters or iframes? Easy peasy lemon squeezy! Now, I understand why these things get added, but will it really benefit the end user? We are big proponents of simplicity; the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/26/improvements-in-windows-explorer.aspx">Explorer UI improvements proposed by the Microsoft team</a> is a perfect example of how an attempt at empowering the end user with a wider set of features can go really wrong. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_it_simple_stupid">KISS</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This usually translates in a plethora of symptoms, some of which you may have experienced first hand;</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Poor SEO</strong>, caused by a lack of semantic, markup sugar-coating (think about the wonderful code that is being dumped in an editor when people are copy-pasting their content straight from Word) and about a gazillion other bad things that happen with that copy-pasting magic or "power user features" (aka "The Button of Doom").</li>
<li><strong>Broken layouts and styles</strong>, because people like to customize (understand cyan with a Comic Sans font), or simply dumping content from a Word document. There is nothing more frustrating than a user taking down the front page you carefully crafted by simply posting a blog post with unclosed markups.</li>
</ol>

<p>And the list goes on. Moreover, as time pass, people ask for even more "essential features" which in turn leads to even more ways of breaking things up. The complexity piles up, and you end up with a pretty nasty piece of code sitting at a crucial bottleneck of your publishing workflow.</p>

<p><strong>We believe that, overall, the use of WYSIWYG editors tends to reinforce the spread of bad practices with regards to Web editing.</strong></p>

So what do we propose then?

<p><strong>We've been going all <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> for the past few years; it's clean, easy to pick up and covers 99.999% of your needs (seriously).</strong></p>

<p>And this is what we strongly encourage our clients to go for. Users may complain at first, pointing at the difficulty of learning yet another way of editing their content or its (intentional) lack of functionality. But there is an inherent efficiency to writing, for example, a link as simply as &#91;Text&#93;(http://link.url.com); no three steps process with a modal dialog or weird shortcuts, just write it as is. And we think there is a lot of value in this approach;</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>It keeps things simple for developers</strong>; no heavy JS plugin to load, no complex modal interactions to add markup, no browser compatibility headache or integration debugging. It is easy to put in place, rock solid and easily extensible.</li>
<li><strong>More importantly, it ensures that the generated code is semantically correct, clean and ultimately help writers focusing on content</strong>; when you use Markdown you have no way of fiddling with complex layout, advanced table features or image alignment. You focus on what you're supposed to do: writing content. Well structured, lean, straight-forward content. And if the end result is not satisfying design-wise, then it may be a good idea to bring your design suggestions as a site-wide style improvement, as opposed to hack your way through with the help of a WYSIWYG editor.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a couple of things that could use some improvements. Media handling In particular, like inserting images, would be nice if slightly more streamlined than manually uploading a file in one place and then pasting the URL in your content; we're actually working on some UI improvements for these specific problems. We have as well in some cases used our <a href="https://github.com/Wiredcraft/custom_bueditor">Markdown capable version of BUEditor</a> on some Drupal 7 sites to help the editors ramp up with the basic syntax.</p>

<p><strong>Let's sum it up; WYSIWYG bad, Markdown good.</strong></p>

    <p>After I joined Acquia in January, I was given the task of assisting in the port of the Acquia.com/Acquia Network web properties to Drupal 7. Although other people were involved in the process, including Jakub Suchy and his team, there was a lot that needed to be ported. One such item was the Acquia Network Connector module, which links a website to the <a href="/products-services/acquia-network">Acquia Network</a> and passes website data after it validates its keys. On one fateful gardening day, I began the task of porting its existing code to Drupal 7, and I found myself quite impressed with its potential. </p>
<p>The Acquia Network Connector module was designed specifically for users running Acquia Drupal, and only those whose core distributions were unmodified. It wasn’t long before Acquia decided to expand the module’s scope by supporting any Drupal distro or code (contrib or custom). This caused some very impressive features in the Connector to have less value, and to stagnate over time. During the port process, I examined these portions of the code and realized that the Connector could be enhanced by exposing more website information to website owners and to our Support team.</p>
<p>I rebuilt the server side of the Connector on a Drupal 7 site, and then created an accompanying analysis site. I used separate sites because I’ve learned that using the same website/codebase for both the back-end processing system and the user display site was a bad idea. Separating the two makes for a more robust configuration. But how do you synchronize them? Answering this question proved to be nearly as large a task as creating Insight.</p>
<p>The biggest problem was that the implemented architecture involved no fewer than 7 different websites! Websites running Drupal 5, Drupal 6, and Drupal 7 all needed up-to-date information on customer accounts, roles, access, and products. Oh... and they needed a single-sign-on between them all. After I looked at it, and I talked to the other big brains at Acquia, I decided on a mixture of the Services module and Bakery. We also created the Services Client module, which is an arbitrary client to services that can be used to synchronize data between sites. I won’t use this post to get into the nitty-gritty, but I think that this architecture can be used to power interconnected systems and sites in most enterprise environments.</p>
<p>Using the new architecture, when content is updated on one site (for example, a user’s Acquia Network subscription), the changes are sent to other sites by passing them through a master data warehousing site. Because each site has a full, local copy of the data they need, the system doesn’t have a dependency on any other particular site.</p>
<p>At the same time (caffeine is helpful for multitasking), I was making incremental progress on an enterprise data management setup I’d been creating. It was a system of passing a larger dataset between then Connector and the server. Ultimately, I was able to have the Connector pass a large amount of data from a client site back to our servers, including hashes of all of the site’s modules and files. We then parse and store the data, which is used by the Insight engine to rate sites, and provide recommendations for website administrators.</p>
<p>We use the data for two different website grades. The first is its <a href="/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/insight">Insight</a> grade, which denotes a site’s performance, security, and adherence to Drupal best practices. While the number of tests can differ based on your installed version of Drupal, at present, a website is evaluated against approximately 50 tests. The second grade is a website’s <a href="/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/seo-grader">SEO Grader</a> rating, which has five separate testing areas. A given website can see as many as 30 different SEO tests run against it. Also, because we used an extensible system for storing and modifying tests (you may know them as nodes), we can easily add more tests for Insight and SEO Grader. Our Support team is already creating a list of items that can be tracked, and scenarios that they’ve found to cause customer problems.</p>
<p>After a lot of testing (including a 3-month beta, a redesign, user testing, and usability studies -- not in that order), we launched Insight and SEO Grader on November 29, 2011. Since that time, we’ve seen our users install the Acquia Network Connector on hundreds of sites, which have then displayed thousands of website alerts for our customers to resolve. Most notably, many of these displayed alerts have been fixed on hundreds of Drupal sites -- a fact that makes Drupal better for everyone.</p>
<p>We’ve only just begun. As Insight’s release neared, many other folks at Acquia saw its benefit for our customers. It was exciting to see developers, designers, testers, marketers, sales people, customer advisors, professional services team members, and dozens of other people at Acquia pitch in to help with the project. At its launch, Insight was more than just an idea I had a year ago, but the culmination of an amazing collaborative effort by over fifty people. Both the product and how it was created give me great pride.</p>
<p>In order to create Insight, the six developers on the Acquia Network team had to create or significantly enhance over thirty modules, many of which we contributed back to the community. Over the next few weeks, I’ll blog about the roadblocks we hit, how we worked around them, and our inspirations. I’ll give you the skinny on how we manage the synchronization of hundreds  of thousands of pieces of data over hundreds of inbound connections, and how we message that data back to you.</p>
<p>While there were a lot of people who’ve directly or indirectly contributed to Insight, I want to thank some folks (...and the Academy... and my fans...) who were instrumental in creating the product that you get to use: Ben Jeavons, Charlie Gordon, James Elliott, Mariano Asselborn, and Martin Hravbocin. Without each of these people, Insight would still just be an idea.</p>
<p>Stay tuned! I’ll post more soon for those of you that want to look under the hood.</p>

I won’t use this post to get into the nitty-gritty, but I think that this architecture can be used to power interconnected systems and sites in most enterprise environments.</p>
<p>Using the new architecture, when content is updated on one site (for example, a user’s Acquia Network subscription), the changes are sent to other sites by passing them through a master data warehousing site. Because each site has a full, local copy of the data they need, the system doesn’t have a dependency on any other particular site.</p>
<p>At the same time (caffeine is helpful for multitasking), I was making incremental progress on an enterprise data management setup I’d been creating. It was a system of passing a larger dataset between then Connector and the server. Ultimately, I was able to have the Connector pass a large amount of data from a client site back to our servers, including hashes of all of the site’s modules and files. We then parse and store the data, which is used by the Insight engine to rate sites, and provide recommendations for website administrators.</p>
<p>We use the data for two different website grades. The first is its <a href="/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/insight">Insight</a> grade, which denotes a site’s performance, security, and adherence to Drupal best practices. While the number of tests can differ based on your installed version of Drupal, at present, a website is evaluated against approximately 50 tests. The second grade is a website’s <a href="/products-services/acquia-network/cloud-services/seo-grader">SEO Grader</a> rating, which has five separate testing areas. A given website can see as many as 30 different SEO tests run against it. Also, because we used an extensible system for storing and modifying tests (you may know them as nodes), we can easily add more tests for Insight and SEO Grader. Our Support team is already creating a list of items that can be tracked, and scenarios that they’ve found to cause customer problems.</p>
<p>After a lot of testing (including a 3-month beta, a redesign, user testing, and usability studies -- not in that order), we launched Insight and SEO Grader on November 29, 2011. Since that time, we’ve seen our users install the Acquia Network Connector on hundreds of sites, which have then displayed thousands of website alerts for our customers to resolve. Most notably, many of these displayed alerts have been fixed on hundreds of Drupal sites -- a fact that makes Drupal better for everyone.</p>
<p>We’ve only just begun. As Insight’s release neared, many other folks at Acquia saw its benefit for our customers. It was exciting to see developers, designers, testers, marketers, sales people, customer advisors, professional services team members, and dozens of other people at Acquia pitch in to help with the project. At its launch, Insight was more than just an idea I had a year ago, but the culmination of an amazing collaborative effort by over fifty people. Both the product and how it was created give me great pride.</p>
<p>In order to create Insight, the six developers on the Acquia Network team had to create or significantly enhance over thirty modules, many of which we contributed back to the community. Over the next few weeks, I’ll blog about the roadblocks we hit, how we worked around them, and our inspirations. I’ll give you the skinny on how we manage the synchronization of hundreds  of thousands of pieces of data over hundreds of inbound connections, and how we message that data back to you.</p>
<p>While there were a lot of people who’ve directly or indirectly contributed to Insight, I want to thank some folks (...and the Academy... and my fans...) who were instrumental in creating the product that you get to use: Ben Jeavons, Charlie Gordon, James Elliot, Mariano Asselborn, and Martin Hravbocin. Without each of these people, Insight would still just be an idea.</p>
<p>Stay tuned! I’ll post more soon for those of you that want to look under the hood.</p>

    <p><strong>Day 2 - More Planning</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.dogstar.org/drupal/files/examinerlogo.jpeg" align="left" />Day 2 of this shortened timebox was the second of our Technical Planning days.  As I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.dogstar.org/drupal/content/life-agile-timebox-examiner">previous post</a>, we have two half days of Technical Architecture/Planning at the beginning of the time box.  We continued to review details on the user stories for this box and also tightened our estimates a little bit for remaining stories.  We look at whether we need to write code from scratch, we can make use of community code, or enhance community code from the Drupal project.</p>
<p>We colour code our stories - white for not scheduled, yellow for scheduled and committed to, greeen for QA ready, salmon when we need more information, and grey for stories that we defer for future timeboxes. We re-reviewed stories from yesterday for which we needed clarifications.  These visual queues make it really easy to scan the Google spreadsheet(s) and see the status of a given story.</p>
<p>Our story spreadsheet header describes the information we're looking to capture for hand off to the development team.</p>

      <a href="/aggregator/sources/1" class="feed-item-source">Ultimas noticias do drupal</a> -

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>There are a lot of places, where you need client's IP address in <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> (or any other CMS/web app of course). The problem arises, when you use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy">reverse proxy server</a> (like <a href="http://varnish-cache.org">Varnish</a>), since every request to web server will be done by the latter. We will have every single visitor of our website coming from a single IP (reverse proxy), as a result.</p>
<p>Drupal is smart enough to overcome that. Reverse proxy servers can be configured to forward original client IP in a request header (usually <em>X-Forwarded-For</em>). This value can be used on web server to know where our visitory come from. In Drupal we have function <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes--bootstrap.inc/function/ip_address/7"><em>ip_address()</em></a>, which will read and return client's IP. If we take a look at this function's code, we can see that it already has support for situations, where reverse proxy is used. This function will still return Varnish's IP address by default, though.</p>
<p>To make things working as we expected, we have to configure at least two variables in <em>settings.php</em>:</p>

// Tell Drupal that we are behind a reverse proxy server
$conf['reverse_proxy'] = TRUE;

// List of trusted IPs (IP numbers of our reverse proxies)
$conf['reverse_proxy_addresses'] = array(
  '127.0.0.1',
);
<p>That's it. Now <em>ip_address()</em> returns IP number that was sent via request header. There is also a possibility to use custom header name:</p>

// Drupal will look for IP in $_SERVER['HTTP_MY_CUSTOM_HEADER']
$conf['reverse_proxy_header'] = 'HTTP_MY_CUSTOM_HEADER';

    <p>Drupal's WYSIWYG editor was once described to me by a colleague as "where the rubber meets the road" for clients. In other words, its the part of the website that your clients will be interacting with the most.  You can spend hours or days perfecting a theme, configuring modules, and writing custom code to make a site as beautiful and useful as possible, but if the WYSIWYG editor does not work as advertised, it can ruin the experience for a client.</p>  </div>

<p>When people say "mobile first" in referring to web design &amp; theming, it's not just a mentality or something people say in a "the way it ought to be" sort of sense. They literally mean, designing the mobile theme first, then adding on CSS for tablets, desktop, and wide desktop themes. In a technical sense, it means that the global.css that contains the basic design elements of the site is loaded no matter what device you are using to view the website. Then,&nbsp;CSS3 Media queries determine what the size of the window is and&nbsp;additional stylesheets will be tacked on; either "narrow", "normal" , or "wide" - depending on the width of the device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  </div>

  Misplaced priorities hampering UK government uptake of open source<br />
<p>
  According to a computing.co.uk article entitled <a href="http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/analysis/2128106/source-government-doing/page/1">Open Source: The government's commitment so far</a>, most of the IT technology used in the UK government is still proprietary and comes from single vendors.
</p>
<p>
  Open Source adoption by government agencies in the UK is progressing, but is still being hindered by a focus on "free as in gratis". Decisions based on cost-of-acquisition alone ignore the other real and more important values offered by open source, which are derived from "free as in freedom".
</p>

<p>
  A policy was set out in 2004 to "level the playing field" for open source solutions in the UK government. Open source solutions are in use in a variety of departments there. Drupal powers the <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">UK Cabinet Office website</a>, among others. The open source policy statement was reiterated in 2009, 2010, and in October 2011 a new "Strategic Implementation Plan" (SIP) covered much of the same ground. Change has been slow to come, but things are looking promising.
</p>
<p>
  The 2011 Strategic Implementation Plan includes an <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/open-source-procurement-toolkit">Open Source Procurement Toolkit</a> to facilitate and help put into action the UK government's stated policy, "Where appropriate, Government will procure open source solutions."
</p>

  "Free as in gratis" is not the point

<p>
  So far, so good, but there's at least one problem. The Strategic Action Plan calls for open source solutions to be considered fairly against proprietary solutions based on "value for money and total cost of ownership".
</p>
<p>
  Psychologically, the "free" in "free and open source software" is a huge trump. Dan Ariely, in the chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/006135323X/">Predictably Irrational</a> called "The Cost of Zero Cost", discussed the power of FREE! (as he calls it). One of the conclusions he comes to after a series of controlled experiments is that FREE! can blind us, to the point of irrationality, to the importance of other factors.
</p>
<p>
  Proprietary software vendors understand this irrationality and in at least one case, have successfully offered one-time, 100% discounts on their software <a href="http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/the-tony-collins-blog/2011/11/free-microsoft-if-you-threaten-to-buy-open-source/index.htm">when threatened with a move to an open source alternative</a>. The power of FREE! (right now!) blinded those involved to the long-term consequences and costs of future license- and upgrade fees, as well as being locked in to proprietary formats, which can force further investment in proprietary solutions.
</p>
<p>
  Simon Phipps, <a href="http://opensource.com/government/11/11/open-source-procurement-toolkit-still-crippled-free">writing on opensource.com</a> says,
</p>

  "The fact that open source software can be obtained without payment of a license fee is a cruel distraction from the real values."

<p>
  Jeff Eaton <a href="http://drupalize.me/videos/why-open-source-matters">made the same point</a> this year at the Do it With Drupal conference,
</p>

  "[Open source software] just happens to have a zero price tag, you're still responsible for it."

<p>
  Both Phipps and Eaton make the point that focusing on a price of zero undermines the real values and strengths of open source solutions like Drupal. Eaton goes on to present better arguments for adopting open source, calling FREE! the worst one on the list.
</p>

  Focus on the real values of open source

<p>
  <strong>Here are some values that proprietary software cannot offer</strong> based on the very definition of open source itself:
</p>
<ul><li>
    <strong>Use it:</strong> You are free to use open source for anything, anywhere, no matter what. In the restaurant business, they say, "You gotta own the bricks." Do you want your government basing its services on something that it has no control over, has to pay for over and over again, that others can arbitrarily turn off, change or charge more for?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Study it:</strong> You are free to understand what you are getting, no hidden surprises. As Eaton puts it, "The bad dies or the bad gets fixed." Quality and security are common outcomes of transparency.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Modify it:</strong> You control your destiny. With open source you have the freedom to build what you need when you need it. If a proprietary solution is buggy, <a href="http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/security/51019-critical-infrastructure-exploitable-vulnerability-will-not-be-patched">it might never be fixed</a>. If it only does 80% of what you need, when do you get the other 20%? Your priorities might not match the proprietary developer's product roadmap.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Share it:</strong> You are free to reuse the best solutions out there. Improve efficiency by building on the shoulders of giants. If you start with an 80% solution based on the work of the Drupal community and build the very best solution for your organization, you can pass it on to your colleagues, other departments, or the whole world, <strong><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/04/21/whitehousegov-releases-open-source-code">just like the White House did</a></strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
  It's getting better all the time

<p>
  Government agencies and departments in the UK are beginning to focus on the real value propositions offered by open source. For instance, the UK government <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/uk-government-open-standards-survey">held consultations in 2011</a> on adopting open standards and intends to have in place a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2011/oct/21/government-ict-strategy-implementation-plan">core set of open standards</a> by June 2012. This is a big step in the right direction. The CIO and senior responsibility officer for open source and open standards of the UK Home Office, Robin Pape, contends that, "Open standards are the real enabler for change." Proprietary solutions are not traditionally focused on these standards–or are actively against them–and Pape concludes, "Open source software is part of the opportunity that arises [from their adoption]."
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2012 is looking good for public-sector open source software adoption in the UK.</strong>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    
    
           <p>When I recently joined Scott Reynen as maintainer of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/fontyourface">@font-your-face module</a> (<a href="http://www.bariswanschers.com/blog/goodbye-google-fonts-hello-font-your-face">blog post</a>), one of the first tasks on my list was to enable site builders to save their font settings using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features</a>. For those not known with Features; it’s a module that saves database settings (views, content types, variables etc) to code. This enables you to save (various) versions of your site in VCS and then move settings from development/staging/production without ‘clicking’. Features is pluggable: if a module has its own hooks for Features, it settings may be exported as well. A lot of contrib modules already come with Features implementation (Views, Rules, Context, Boxes, etc) and we thought it’d be great if we could add @font-your-face to this list as well.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="media-image" src="http://www.bariswanschers.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/exporting-fonts.png" /><br /><em>The Features integration of the @font-your-face module</em></p>
<p>There are basically two options to make your module exportable: using Ctools or by writing your custom code. Using Ctools is by far the easiest and simplest method to implement, but it comes with some limitations. Using custom code gives you more flexibility, but it involves also a bit more effort.</p>
Exporting configuration using Ctools
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/ctools">Ctools</a> (chaos tools suite) is an API module used by more and more contrib modules. Panels, Views, Rules UI, Boxes, Context; all of them rely on Ctools. It comes with an export API that you can use to export your own module configuration in a standardized way. It involves three simple steps:</p>
<ol><li>Define the data you want to export by expanding your hook_schema() with an ‘export’ part.</li>
	<li>Write a load() function</li>
	<li>Write a save() function</li>
</ol><p>Stella wrote <a href="http://stellapower.net/content/using-chaos-tools-module-create-exportables">a great blog post</a> about this method and more details can be found on Drupal.org: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/928026">http://drupal.org/node/928026</a></p>
<p>Basically, Ctools export <strong>moves your database settings to code</strong> and once they are exported, Drupal doesn’t use the database entries anymore. This method works great in most use cases. And the good thing is that it comes with an admin interface where you can enable/disable/revert your custom settings, similar to the interface that comes with Context and Views. But I found two drawbacks that made that I couldn’t use this method for the @font-your-face module:</p>
1. The ‘Create Feature’ interface lists ALL settings, even those that are not enabled
<p>This works fine if you have ten content types, or twenty views. But with @font-your-face you can import several thousands of fonts and then enable just a few of them. As Features shows all configurations independent of their state, the lists of Components became extremely long and slow to use. I couldn’t find a way to filter this list of checkboxes using the default Ctools Export UI.</p>
2. The exported configurations cannot be retrieved using Views
<p>The function that loads all your objects (ctools_export_crud_load_all()) first retrieves <strong>all the stored settings from your code</strong> and then <strong>combines</strong> this with the database settings for all settings <strong>that have not been exported</strong>. The @font-your-face admin interface uses a nifty Views interface to simplify the admin UI. It shows all the imported fonts (which can be a several thousand) in a nice interface with filters, sorts, etc. By exporting fonts using Ctools they were moved out of the database and thus cannot be retrieved by Views anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve posted <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1315086">an issue</a> in the Ctools issue queue to highlight my findings and merlinofchaos confirmed this behaviour. As Scott and I didn’t want to give up the Views admin interface, we needed another method.</p>
Exporting configuration using custom code
<p>It is also possible to write your own hooks for features. By doing so, you can define which configrations to show in the export interface, and how they are loaded. I’ll show the code that I’ve used for the @font-your-face module as this explains better how it works. The steps needed to get this working are:</p>
1. Make your module known to Features using hook_features_api()
<p>Implement hook_features_api() in your .module file (fontyourface.module).</p>
/**
 * Implements hook_features_api().
 */
function fontyourface_features_api() {
  return array(
    'fontyourface' =&gt; array(
      'name' =&gt; '@font-your-face',
      'file' =&gt; drupal_get_path('module', 'fontyourface') . '/fontyourface.features.inc',
      'default_hook' =&gt; 'fontyourface_features_default_font',
      'feature_source' =&gt; TRUE,
    ),
  );
}

2. Define which settings you want to list in the export UI using hook_features_export_options()
<p>This hook will alert features of which specific items of this component may be exported. For instances, in this case, we want to make available all the existing items.  If there are no items to be exported, this component will not be made available in the features export page.</p>
/**
 * @return array
 *   A keyed array of items, suitable for use with a FormAPI select or
 *   checkboxes element.
 */
function fontyourface_features_export_options() {
  $fonts = array();

  foreach (fontyourface_get_fonts('enabled = 1') as $font) {
    $fonts[$font-&gt;name] = $font-&gt;name;
  }

  return $fonts;
}

3. Use hook_features_export() to add your dependencies to the FEATURENAME.info file
<p>This is a component hook, rather then a module hook, therefore this is the callback from hook_features_api which relates to the specific component we are looking to export.  When a specific instance of the component we are looking to export is selected, this will include the necessary item, plus any dependencies into our export array.</p>
/**
 * @param array $data
 *   this is the machine name for the component in question
 * @param array &amp;$export
 *   array of all components to be exported
 * @param string $module_name
 *   The name of the feature module to be generated.
 * @return array
 *   The pipe array of further processors that should be called
 */
function fontyourface_features_export($data, &amp;$export, $module_name = '') {

  // fontyourface_default_fonts integration is provided by Features.
  $export['dependencies']['features'] = 'features';
  $export['dependencies']['fontyourface'] = 'fontyourface';

  // Add dependencies for each font.
  $fonts = fontyourface_get_fonts('enabled = 1');

  foreach ($fonts as $font) {
    if (in_array($font-&gt;name, $data)) {

      // Make the font provider required
      $export['dependencies'][$font-&gt;provider] = $font-&gt;provider;

      $export['features']['fontyourface'][$font-&gt;name] = $font-&gt;name;
    }
  }

  return $export;
}

4. hook_features_export_render() renders the actual settings to export
<p>This hook will be invoked in order to export Component hook. The hook should be implemented using the name ot the component, not the module, eg. [component]_features_export() rather than [module]_features_export().</p>
/**
 * Render one or more component objects to code.
 *
 * @param string $module_name
 *   The name of the feature module to be exported.
 * @param array $data
 *   An array of machine name identifiers for the objects to be rendered.
 * @param array $export
 *   The full export array of the current feature being exported. This is only
 *   passed when hook_features_export_render() is invoked for an actual feature
 *   update or recreate, not during state checks or other operations.
 * @return array
 *   An associative array of rendered PHP code where the key is the name of the
 *   hook that should wrap the PHP code. The hook should not include the name
 *   of the module, e.g. the key for `hook_example` should simply be `example`.
 */
function fontyourface_features_export_render($module, $data) {
  $fonts = fontyourface_get_fonts('enabled = 1');
  $code = array();
  foreach ($data as $name) {
    foreach ($fonts as $font) {
      if ($font-&gt;name == $name) {
        unset($font-&gt;fid); // unset the identifier, as this may not be the same on other environments (staging/production/etc)
        $code[$name] = $font;
      }
    }
  }
  $code = "  return " . features_var_export($code, '  ') . ";";
  return array('fontyourface_features_default_font' =&gt; $code);
}

5. And finally, make sure your module loads it settings from the exported code once a feature gets reverted.
/**
 * Implements hook_features_revert().
 */
function fontyourface_features_revert($module) {
  fontyourface_features_rebuild($module);
}

/**
 * Implements hook_features_rebuild().
 *
 * Rebuilds @font-your-face fonts from code defaults.
 */
function fontyourface_features_rebuild($module) {
  $saved_fonts = module_invoke($module, 'fontyourface_features_default_font');

  foreach ($saved_fonts as $key =&gt; $font) {
    $font = (object) $font;
    $saved = fontyourface_save_font($font, TRUE); // Here it gets saved in the database -&gt; TRUE overrides existing fonts. 
  }
}

So, which method to use when?
<p>If your custom module has only a small amount of configurations (like Views, Rules, Context, etc) the Ctools way is a great and standarized way to get you up to speed. It comes with a nice admin UI and the time to implement Features integration in your module using this method can be done within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>If your module has a lot of possible configurations (like hundreds) or if you use Views to list all available configurations – you might be better of without Ctools.</p>

    <p><strong>An Introduction to the Next 15 Work Days</strong><br />
I've been writing a lot about process lately.  Examiner.com is one of the largest Drupal sites in the wild.  It was migrated from Cold Fusion to Drupal - a process that began about two years ago.  </p>
<p>The Examiner development experience has moved through a wide variety of styles, tools, and  methodologies over the last two years.  Through blog posts and presentations, a fair bit of information is being shared about how we operate.  When I was in Austin presenting, a fairly significant number of folks asked specific questions about our "Generic Timebox".  I wanted to answer all the questions, but ran out of time that afternoon.  </p>
<p>For this timebox we are using a compressed time-line.  Our normal interval is 20 days - in this case we are shaving off a week and making it 15 days because of the holidays.  Still, all the elements that are in our normal period are reflected in this series of days making it pretty much perfect to (hopefully) answer the questions I was being asked.</p>
