After the great succes of <a href="http://openidealapp.com" rel="nofollow">Open ideaL</a>, our Drupal based idea management platform, and as part of our global strategy, we are working on a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/175329" rel="nofollow">Drupal app store</a> that will serve Drupal apps to various platforms (including Open ideaL of course). The subject was partially <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/conference/sessions/taking-inventory-drupal-products-and-app-stores" rel="nofollow">covered in London</a>.<br />
Several platforms function today with app-like modules, and in order to increase interoperability between the platforms, a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/open-app-standard" rel="nofollow">g.d.o. group</a> was set up, where different providers try to reach an agreed format for apps.<br />
Linnovate will use <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/open-app-standard/oas" rel="nofollow">the standard</a> in order to build a server-client model, where independent stores will be able to provide apps to Drupal websites and cloud based services. Having several Drupal app stores will create new business opportunities for independent developers and Drupal shops, and will ease the adoption of Drupal by those who are used to the apps model (notably in the mobile platforms). <strong>Installing a new functionality in Drupal should be as easy as installing an app on your mobile device</strong>.</p>
<p>Come join the discussion: <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/175329" title="http://groups.drupal.org/node/175329" rel="nofollow">http://groups.drupal.org/node/175329</a></p>  </div>

    <p>Today <a href="http://acquia.com/blog/5-days-5-challenges-drupal">Jakub Suchy proposed a really cool thing</a> on his blog. Idea is about spending 30 minutes each day in the next week to contribute something to Drupal. He proves, that only 63 people doing this, can do as much work as an individual could do in a month.</p>
<p>Since I immediately loved this idea, I decided to join. Here is my plan for <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/d5dchallenge">#d5dChallenge</a>:</p>
<ul><li><b>Day 1:</b> improve <a href="http://drupal.org/project/media_derivatives">Media derivatives API</a> views support,</li>
<li><strong>Day 2:</strong> write some docs for Media derivatives API,</li>
<li><b>Day 3:</b> work on YouTube uploader engine for Media derivatives API,</li>
<li><strong>Day 4:</strong> spend some time in Media issue queue; find some issue to review or submit a simple patch; find some issues I could help with <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/173749">during Media code sprint</a>,</li>
<li><strong>Day 5:</strong> do some research about Rules integration development and plan Rules integration for Media derivatives API.</li>
</ul><p>What do you think about this list? You can also propose something else, if you think I should rather work on some other tasks during this week.</p>
<p>Will you join too? I hope there will be even more than 63 of us!</p>

    <a href="http://randyfay.com/node/112">Randy Fay: Drupal Community Conflict Resolution (and Twitter)</a>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>We value our community like a family, and have put loads of energy into the Drupal world. But we have some problems, and it's probably time for some discussion about our community manners and approach to problem-solving.  We have the excellent <a href="http://drupal.org/dcoc">Drupal Code of Conduct</a> (copied from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct">Ubuntu's model</a>) but it doesn't yet address a number of specifics (especially conflict resolution). So I'd like to throw some ideas into the wild.</p>
<p>First of all, <strong>Controversy</strong> is not a bad thing. It's not a problem when people disagree on issues, even if they permanently disagree. It <em>is</em> a bad thing,, though, when people start campaigns (on Twitter or otherwise) without understanding the problem or trying to resolve it directly. Feelings can be hurt, the community can be divided, contributor energy can be sapped, and it's mostly not the most likely way to resolve the situation anyway. Why do that?</p>
<p><strong>Name Calling</strong>, <strong>Personal Attacks</strong>, and <strong>Twitter Pile-ons</strong> are not the way to resolve problems in the community. They just create new problems. I recently wrote and spoke about <a href="http://randyfay.com/taxonomy/term/27">Burnout in the community</a> and many people responded favorably - it seemed to strike a chord with the community, because everybody knows how dispiriting it is to get worn down with responsibilities. But if we add to that hurt feelings (and worse) due to misunderstandings, rudeness, and the like, we end up with something perhaps worse than burnout.</p>
<p>I propose that we discuss some additions to the <a href="http://drupal.org/dcoc">Drupal Code of Conduct</a>, either formally or informally.</p>
<ul><li>When you see something that you think is wrong (or that you otherwise disagree with), approach the party responsible directly rather than making an immediate public statement.</li>
<li>Try to understand and resolve the situation directly with the parties directly involved. A discussion may help to
<ul><li>Understand the actual issue.</li>
<li>Understand the history behind the issue.</li>
<li>Have a complete understanding of the facts involved.</li>
<li>Understand how each party understands those facts</li>
<li>Understand the emotions involved involving each party.</li>
<li>Figure out a course of action to resolve the problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If direct communication fails, pursue formal or informal community conflict resolution channels. Let's establish a conflict resolution methodology. For starters, we have a number of trusted and level-headed community members who might be willing to serve as moderators or arbitrators.</li>
</ul><p>I don't think that twitter and related fast-communication techniques are bad for general discussion or notification, but they're really lousy for actually solving (or even understanding) real problems. Let's tone down the public pile-on (and related public attacks) and find more successful ways to actually get something done. And let's all just review the <a href="http://drupal.org/dcoc">DCOC</a>, especially <a href="http://drupal.org/dcoc#consideration">Be Considerate</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/dcoc#respect">Be Repectful</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/dcoc#collaboration">Be Collaborative</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/dcoc#conflict-resolution">When We Disagree We Consult Others</a>. Oh, that's almost the whole thing, isn't it :-)</p>
<p>I'll write soon proposing some first ideas with an actual conflict resolution technique.</p>

                    <p>In the Drupal community, openly disliking a module is quite rare. Even when commenting on the lower and of the crappy and abandoned modules, developers usually say &#8220;I&#8217;d use module X instead&#8221;. When it comes to the Rules module, however, I have several times heard people saying things like &#8220;I don&#8217;t like Rules&#8221; or &#8220;I think Rules is a bad&nbsp;idea&#8221;.</p>
<p>This dismissal of one of the most used of Drupal&#8217;s modules is, to put it bluntly, arrogant. With this blog post I hope to make clear why Rules is an important part of the Drupal ecosystem, and why you as a developer should know it. (Yes, that means <em>you</em>. Consider this a deliberate kick in the&nbsp;bum.)</p>

  One of the great assets of the Drupal Community are its events: from local to regional and specialist meet-ups and user groups, to DrupalCamps and summits, and of course the big international DrupalCon conferences. One of Acquia's core goals is to grow and nurture the Drupal project and spends a lot of time, <a href="http://buytaert.net/does-acquia-suck-up-all-the-drupal-talent">effort, and money</a> supporting these events. As part of this, I signed up to attend <a href="http://drupalcity.de">DrupalCity Berlin</a> with Jeffrey A. "jam" McGuire and over 300 other attendees eager to talk, live, code, and drink Drupal on September 17th and 18th.
</p>
<p>
  Though I usually give technically-focused presentations, I signed up this time to tell a story about why and how you should contribute to Drupal. I struggled to find the best way to help people understand how to get started contributing to Drupal right now. Then I had an idea...
</p>
<p>
  I present you:
</p>

  The Drupal 5 Day Challenge<br />
<p>
  Every day, for the next 5 days, I will contribute 30 minutes of my own time to the Drupal community. That's 2.5 hours of giving back to Drupal next week.
</p>
<p>
  I challenge all of you to join this effort and help make Drupal better!
</p>
<p>
  If just 63 others–63 of the roughly 600,000 Drupal community members–join me, that's 160 hours, one month of 40-hour weeks of contributing to the Drupal project!
</p>
<p>
  Tweet every day using the <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/d5dchallenge">#d5dChallenge</a></strong> hashtag and help promote this effort! Tweet what you are doing, tweet what needs doing, ideas, and most of all, contribute!
</p>
<p>
  Some suggested tweets:
</p>
<ul><li>

<li>
    <em>How can I contribute to #Drupal this week? Tag your ideas with #d5dChallenge.</em>
  </li>

    <p>One of the first projects I am working on here at ThinkShout requires full-text search of file attachments.

We're also using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/facetapi">Facet API</a> module to allow the users to filter their searches based on certain criteria or "facets".  The Facet API module provides several useful facets out-of-the-box, such as a filter by Author and by Content Type.</p>

<p>Since working for Acquia I interact with dozens of different client every day, and even though most use the Acquia Managed Cloud or Acquia DevCloud environments there are varying development methods and workflows used. I thought I would blog about my preferred workflow, then you can tell me about your.</p>
<p>So, this site is Drupal 7, hosted with Acquia Managed Cloud. All of my code is version controlled via git.<br /><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110916-ja5nbfj2ynpbr9hg1733n71pd8.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>
<p>Any changes I do to the site I do locally on Acquia DevDesktop, these changes are then pushed to the master git branch which is then auto deployed on my staging environment. Once I have checked this I will push live buy dragging and dropping the stage code to production in the Acquia Network, this creates a tag in git.</p>
<p>All content is added directly on live, I can pull this back to staging within the Acquia Network, and I can replace my local copy from nightly backups.</p>
<p>As I am the only developer on the site all configuration via the Drupal UI I usually do on the production site. This is not big, or clever! I would advise using the features module, and the many add-on modules for features to save configuration changes on the local machine. These can then be pushed via git to staging, then to production. Anything not covered by features I would create a custom module with an install file and update functions. These update functions can make any MySQL commands or function calls needed to make updates. This can be tested on staging by running update.php or drush updb.</p>
<p>I think that covers most things, how do you do it? any questions?</p>

<p>Recently, I designed, themed and developed a new site for my photography, <a href="http://highrockphoto.com" target="_blank">High Rock Photo</a>. The obvious choice for this new site was to use Drupal 7. I wanted the ability to easily create node galleries and this screencast shows you how to create and theme a node photo gallery using Drupal 7.  I will also point out what modules are needed and make reference to those that would have been used in Drupal 6 and are now integrated into core in Drupal 7. </p>

<p>I am going to start holding IRC meetings every other week to discuss and plan issues around the configuration management initiative. These meetings will be held every other Tuesday at 19:00 UTC. In real world terms this currently translates to</p>
<p>11:00 - US West coast (PST)<br />
13:00 - US Midwest (CST)<br />
14:00 - US East coast (EST)<br />
20:00 - UK (BST)<br />
21:00 - Most of Europe (CEST)</p>
<p>I tried my best to figure out a time that would work for the most people involved, didn't conflict with any other initiatives, and didn't keep me up all night :)</p>
<p>The first meeting is going to be Tuesday, September 20, and the channel is #drupal-cmi. I am also going to start hanging out in that channel when I'm on IRC if anyone wants to have discussions at any other time. If you're interested, feel free to sign up at</p>

    <p>Building the <a href="http://wedful.com" title="Wedful. Beautiful wedding websites.">Wedful</a> platform took me about a year of pain, tears, blood, and triumph (not necessarily in that order) and since then I've been contacted by several people going through the same difficulties themselves with putting together their own <a href="http://www.drupal.org" title="Drupal">Drupal</a> platform. Wedful is designed specifically for couples planning their weddings to be able to easily launch a website and manage the details surrounding their weddings online, so we needed to be able to easily manage hundreds (hopefully tens of thousands someday) in a scalable manner. Some of the people I've spoken to have been looking to build niche products for the <a href="http://aioliweb.com/">restaurant industry</a>, hotel industry, and even one with a similar concept to <a href="http://www.drupalgardens.com/">Drupal Gardens</a>.</p>
<p>Over the next several weeks (more likely months, there's a lot to cover ;-)) I'll be writing a series of blog posts on just this topic to help anyone else looking to build a Drupal platform of their own. Something that will hopefully reduce the pain, tears, and blood aspect of the process :). I'll initially cover all of the fundamentals and building blocks of the process, such as best practices, features, drush, make files, etc. and then get into the bigger topics of install profiles, distributions and using <a href="http://community.aegirproject.org/">Aegir</a> to actually build a vanilla Drupal platform. Following that I'd like to write about some more advanced topics such as passing data from Aegir to your site and not giving up UID 1 when you give away sites to the masses.</p>
<p>This will all be Drupal 7 centric, though I'm certain that much of the information will apply back to Drupal 6 (I'll try and make notes where this isn't the case) and likely forward to Drupal 8. Since I've done only a small amount of work on platforms in D7 this will be a learning process for me too, as I work through building a comprehensive Drupal 7 platform.</p>
<p>Ultimately I plan on focusing on two main use cases. The first would be a <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> style of service for simple brochure websites. The second will be using the same techniques to manage a single site deployment with a scalable dev -&gt; stage-&gt; live workflow. Both use very similar techniques so almost everything I cover will apply to each use case.</p>
<p>I'll start next week with a few posts on building <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">features</a>. If there's anything anyone's interested in learning more about that's inline with this "platform" topic, just post a comment or send me an email and I'll see if I can work it in. </p>  </div>

Nathaniel <a href="http://drupal.org/user/35733">"catch"</a> Catchpole. These were some of the key people in a series of conversations about the maintainability , a retrospective of what happened during the Drupal 7 development cycle, and the future of Drupal core. Developer burnout is also becoming more of an issue, and they talk about the importance of recruiting more "code gardeners" to help review and evaluate core patches. Listen in for a wide-ranging and engaging discussion about some of the higher-level issues that are often overlooked in the course of developing the Drupal project. </p>
Show notes
<p>At the beginning of DrupalCon London, one of the top Drupal core developers named Daniel Kudwien (aka "<a href="http://drupal.org/user/54136">"sun"</a>) posted a blog called <a href="http://www.unleashedmind.com/en/blog/sun/the-drupal-crisis">"The Drupal Crisis"</a> about the woes of the Drupal 7 development cycle. He claimed that "Drupal core is not maintainable anymore. There's too much cruft. Too many half-baked features that no one actually maintains." and that "We need to be a solid framework, and also a basic but extensible CMS, like we've always been."</p>
<p>After lots of discussion on this post, Sun wrote a <a href="http://www.unleashedmind.com/en/blog/sun/crisis-conclusions">follow-up blog post</a> with a number of conclusions including "We need to discuss, propose, agree, and define what we are able and want to maintain in Drupal core," "which core features are actually product features," and "whether we can or want to move product features into a separate product project in the long-term."</p>
<p>Channelling this interest into action, sun created a number of different issues within the drupal.org issue queue including this list of <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1262752">Discussion items</a> and this <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1255674">"Make core maintainable"</a> issue, which generated nearly 300 comments.</p>
<p>The "Make core maintainable" issue quickly turned into a discussion of which modules to remove from Drupal 8 core, and the question of what should stay and what should go led some core developers like <a href="http://drupal.org/node/764558#comment-4914222">Crell</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1255674#comment-4914450">eaton<a /> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1255674#comment-4914542">catch</a> to call for a more defined set of heuristics that the Drupal core maintainers could use in determining what should be included within the Drupal core product. </a></a></p>
<p>This discussion eventually led Jeff Eaton to create a spin-off issue called <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1273344">"Establish heuristics for core feature evaluation"</a> that tries to lay out a list of criteria for evaluating which features should stay and what modules should go.</p>
<p>Asking what modules belong in core and which ones should be removed can be answered differently depending on whether you see Drupal as a primarily as a generalized CMS product or whether you see it as a development framework for a specific site. It's actually both a framework and a CMS product, but this tension has brought the Drupal project to a crossroads when trying to make these types of decisions of what to include in the main project and what core developers are responsible for maintaining.</p>
<p>Eaton talked more about this tension between product and framework at DrupalCon London in his presentation called <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/drupalcon-london/sgkbz/">"Product, Framework, or Platform?"</a> Instead of creating a false dichotomy between the Product vs. Framework, eaton is using the term of "Platform" in order to incorporate both the CMS product and anything else that can be created with the module system and development framework.</p>
<p>Another top core developer Nathaniel Catchpole (aka <a href="http://drupal.org/user/35733">catch</a>) wrote up a couple of related blog posts including <a href="http://ca.tchpole.net/node/3">"Why all the drama?",</a> where he does a bit of a retrospective as to what went wrong with the D7 development cycle from his perspective. </p>
<p>Catch also took a stab at expanding on the Drupal Framework vs. Product debate in another blog post called <a href="http://ca.tchpole.net/node/4">"Framework, Platform, Application, Features, Product, Workload"</a> where he reiterates that Drupal is a hybrid of the two. He lays out a more nuanced and complicated 5-layered system for how he thinks of it, which is mentioned in this podcast a couple of times.</p>
<p>At the bottom of his post, catch points to a number of follow-up and related initiatives. Catch and sun created the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1224666">"Unofficial Drupal 8 Framework initiative"</a> that includes a lot of the low-level API clean-up. </p>
<p>In this podcast, catch and sun talk about the need to simplify and de-couple the system.module's responsibilities in order to do unit testing and make core debugging more manageable.  Here's a list of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=Framework%20Initiative">issues tagged as part of this framework initiative.</a></p>
<p>There's also a number of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=Platform%20Initiative">issues tagged with the Platform Initiative</a>, which is centering around the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1273344">heuristics</a> for which features should be in Drupal core, and which ones should be removed.</p>
<p>Another related project is eaton's <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/snowman">Snowman initiative</a> in order to create a number of installation profiles that give users a more options for what flavor of Drupal product that they'd like to use.  There's also a meta issue from eaton <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1242448">"[meta] More flexibility for core installation profiles."</a></p>
<p>A related topic throughout all these discussions has been burnout of core developers.  Randy Fay held <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/coreconversation/1700-1730-burnout">Core Conversation about Burnout</a> at DrupalCon London that is well worth watching. Fay also looked into a lot of research into burnout, and wrote an excellent series of blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://randyfay.com/node/107">What is burnout?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://randyfay.com/node/109">What can Individuals do to prevent burnout?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://randyfay.com/node/110">How does the Drupal community burn people out?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://randyfay.com/node/111">What can the Drupal community do about burnout?</a></li>

<p>In his Drupal Crisis post, sun says that "there are many more Drupal contributors who kept silent about their personal feelings for too long. In the end, we have several critical communication problems about fundamental topics in our community." This has been contributing to the feeling of burnout.</p>
<p>One solution to core burnout is to recruit more help for the core development workload. Sun and catch talk about the need in the Drupal core development community to recruit and <a href="http://www.unleashedmind.com/en/blog/sun/leadership">mentor</a> more people who <a href="http://blog.boombatower.com/diaries-of-a-core-developer#comment-110">"code gardeners"</a> can test and evaluate patches.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>I work on a lot of legacy sites that were built without the Context module, and I would say that at least once on each of these legacy sites, I turn to Context when I have a very specific problem: the visibility settings for a particular block are so complex that (in Drupal 6 at least) they can only be expressed by writing code. For instance: suppose you're using Organic Groups, and you want to show or hide a block based on whether the user is a member of that group. You can jam a ton of code into the PHP visibility settings for the block; or, if you don't hate yourself, you can let Context do it for you. Excellent.</p>

<p>The problem is, unless you put <em>all</em> your blocks under the control of Context, you don't have total control over the weight of Context-controlled blocks within their regions. You can control the order of blocks within a given context, of course, but there's no way to order Drupal-controlled blocks and Context-controlled blocks in a unified way. The only solution that I know of is to move all your blocks into Context.</p>

<p>Today, however, I cooked up an alternative solution. Here's the general idea:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a context as you normally would.</li>
<li>Don't assign any reactions to the context (or, if you do, make sure none of them involve enabling blocks).</li>
<li>Using Drupal's native block system (admin/build/block), assign your block to the region you want and order it as you wish among the other blocks.</li>
<li><p>Now, here is the trick: set the block's visibility to PHP code and call this function as many times as is needed:</p>

<p>yourtheme_context_is_active('name_of_context');</p>

<p>For example, if you had a context named 'group_post', and another named 'user_is_member_of_group', and you wanted them both to be active, you would put this in the PHP visibility settings for the block:</p>

<p>return yourtheme_context_is_active('group_post') &amp;&amp; yourtheme_context_is_active('user_is_member_of_group');</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The code we put in yourtheme_context_is_active() calls a Context function and tells you whether the context is active.</p>

<p>What I like about this solution is that it allows you to use blocks as you normally would, but to use Context selectively, for the situations where your block visibility rules are complex enough that you don't want to write cumbersome code that could create maintenance issues. It also keeps as much code out of the database as possible.</p>

<p>Here's yourtheme_context_is_active():</p>

function niot_is_context_active($context) {
    if (module_exists('context')) {
        $active_contexts = context_active_contexts();
        if ($active_contexts) {
            if (array_key_exists($context, $active_contexts)) {
                return TRUE;
            }
        }
    }

    return FALSE;  
}


<p>Put that in template.php and you're good to go.</p>

<p>Certainly could be a better way to do it out there, though, so if you know of one, feel free to let me know!</p>  </div>

<strong>Great, so where’s my %#@&amp;$! invitation?</strong>

<p>First, a shout-out to everyone on our beta list who's been waiting so patiently. Hi folks! We're sending invites as quick as we can.</p>

<p>In the mean time we’re reserving some space for large projects and will continue to share invites at the same rate, but we're not going to be able to truly open up the firehose until later in October.</p>

<p>We'll be announcing these improvements and offering an "under the hood" tour of the system at this fall's biggest Drupal event: <a href="http://2011.badcamp.net" title="The social event of the season!" target="_blank">BADCamp</a> on October 21st/22nd.

<p>Until then, shops and pros launching live sites and new projects, <a href="https://getpantheon.com/contact">let's talk</a>.</p>

<strong>Stay tuned</strong>

<p>We'll soon be posting progress updates on next-generation infrastructure, availability and pricing, as well as on our vision for how Pantheon and Drupal will work together to power a major portion of the web in coming years.</p>  </div>

<p>The Pantheon platform currently supports hundreds of Drupal developers with more than fifty paying customers and hundreds more on the way. In the six months since DrupalCon Chicago, our beta test members have inspired us and pushed us to create a great product.</p>

<p>To Kelly Bell at <a href="http://gothamcitydrupal.com" target="_blank">Gotham City Drupal</a>; Nir at <a href="http://medico.com" target="_blank">Medico</a> and his awesome developers Amatai and Brice at <a href="http://gizra.com" target="_blank">Gizra</a>; Austin &amp; Co. at <a href="http://alleyinteractive.com" target="_blank">Alley interactive</a>; and all of the other Drupalists who have filed issues or given us feedback — Team Pantheon gives a huge <strong>THANK YOU</strong> for working along with us.</p>

<p>If you’ve never heard of Pantheon before, check out the tour and the screencast to get a flavor of what it’s all about.</p>

<strong>Real projects, real success</strong>

<p>We believe Pantheon will help drive Drupal’s next decade of growth by supercharging every kind of Drupalist working every kind of project. It’s already happening. Our customers’ success stories come in all sizes: personal sites, community sites, government sites, major brands, international projects. </p>

<p>We've got a leading business school and a site for finding deals in Vegas; a libertarian PAC and a world-government program; a high-end home-decor showcase and a medical info resource for users in the developing world. The people building these sites include A-list Drupal shops, individual consultants and in-house talent — and they're all thriving thanks the platform we’ve built together.</p>

<p>And now we're ready to bring it to the Drupal public.</p>

<strong>Great, so where’s my %#@&amp;$! invitation?</strong>

<p>First, a shout-out to everyone on our beta list who's been waiting so patiently. Hi folks! We're sending invites as quick as we can, but we're also getting new signups 3x as fast. Our backlog is now thousands of Drupal developers deep.</p>

<p>Our current infrastructure is nearly at capacity (fun fact: Pantheon now operates more than 350 instances in the Rackspace Cloud), but never fear! We engineers are finishing infrastructure improvements that will blow us past these limitations and let us offer Pantheon to everyone in the backlog — and beyond.</p>

<p>In the mean time we’re reserving some space for large projects and will continue to share invites at the same rate, but we're not going to be able to truly open up the firehose until later in October.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.leveltendesign.com/services/training">Here’s a list of the courses we will be offering:</a></p>
<p><strong>Drupal in a Day</strong><br />
Houston, TX - Oct. 10<br />
Dallas, TX - Oct. 17<br />
New Orleans, LA - Dec. 5<br />
Drupal in a Day will be an overview of creating a Drupal site from start to finish. Participants will start with a blank website and, already having seen the final site, will start with adding and managing users, creating user profiles, adding custom content, and managing that content.</p>
<p><strong>Drupal 7 Site Building</strong><br />
Houston, TX - Oct. 11<br />
Dallas, TX - Oct. 18<br />
New Orleans, LA - Dec. 6<br />
In two days time, participants will be brought up to speed on Drupal and be ready to tackle their own project. This course is designed both for users with no Drupal experience and those who are familiar with Drupal and want to expand their knowledge and dig deeper into their sites. The course provides in-depth discussions on Drupal’s installation process and managing users, comments, and content. Participants will also review Drupal's block system and using taxonomy to categorize their content.</p>
<p><strong>Drupal 7 Theming</strong><br />
Dallas, TX - Oct. 24<br />
By starting with the bare bones of Drupal theming to completing a custom theme, you will understand the concepts of overriding, intercepting and altering markup in Drupal. You will do a step-by-step walk through creating a new theme based on a well tested theme development framework using development best practices. You will go in more depth to coding a custom theme, using pre-process functions and theme functions to get fine-grained control. Then learn how to ensure your themes are secure, and stable. Learn how to control the output of fields and Views.</p>
<p><strong>PHP for Drupal</strong><br />
Dallas, TX - Oct. 26<br />
PHP is a powerful scripting language for templating web pages that is widely in use for its flexibility and ease of use. Drupal, built on PHP, relies on the use of a unique combination of procedural and some OOP practices. Development of both Drupal themes and modules requires an understanding of PHP. This is a refresher for anyone who is familiar with PHP, and a solid introduction to coding with PHP for anyone new to the language, or new to programming.</p>
<p><strong>Drupal 7 Module Development</strong><br />
Dallas, TX - Oct. 27<br />
Learn how to get custom functionality using Drupal’s hook system, as well as how to extend or alter contributed module functionality. Participants in this course will have used CCK, Views and Panels to create websites but have never built their own module. Participants will start writing a simple module to writing a complex module, step by step which uses Forms API, Schema API, all of the top ten Drupal hooks, creates custom database tables.</p>
