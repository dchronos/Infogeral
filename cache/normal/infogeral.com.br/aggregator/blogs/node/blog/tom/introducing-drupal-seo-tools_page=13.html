      <a href="/aggregator/sources/1" class="feed-item-source">Ultimas noticias do drupal</a> -
      <span class="feed-item-date">Ter, 15/11/2011 - 13:29</span>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    
    
            
                    <img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/imagecache/blog_teaser/BrocoMagi.png" alt="" title="" class="imagecache imagecache-blog_teaser imagecache-default imagecache-blog_teaser_default" width="300" height="250" />        
        

<p>In <a href="http://www.leveltendesign.com/blog/david-hahn/learning-drupal-part-1">Part 1 of Learning Drupal</a> we looked at learning considerations, seeing what Drupal can do and being inspired, diving in, local user groups and DrupalCamps.  In Part 1.5 I shamelessly plugged a Drupal themer / developer position we had open (what better way to learn Drupal??).</p>
<p>We now continue in Part 2. Wondering about the picture?  That's the <strong>Broco Magi</strong>, the most educated and revered of all the vegetable people, and the official mascot of the Learning Drupal series.  Hey, I was playing with my food, ok? You'd rather have another fuzzy picture of some training class or the partially photogenic LevelTen team??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Training
<p>For many people, a formal training class is the way to learn Drupal.  At $300-$400 / day for a public class it isn't cheap, but for a Drupal expert to shovel wisdom and experience into your brain for 6-8 hours, it isn't that expensive either.  Especially if your company is paying for it :)</p>
<p>Two training systems to consider- Acquia and Chapter Three.  Acquia offers courses like <em>Drupal in a Day</em> and the two-day <em>Sitebuilding with Drupal</em>.  Chapter Three has <em>Drupal Fundamentals</em> and <em>Development Best Practices</em>.  <img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/a-training.png" width="280" height="200" alt="a-training.png" href="http://training.acquia.com/events" /> Various companies offer the Acquia training (including <a href="http://www.leveltendesign.com/services/training">LevelTen!</a>)  Take a look at <a href="http://training.acquia.com/events">Acquia's calendar</a> and see if there's something near (or maybe somewhere you'd like to go, like <a href="http://www.drupalonthebayou.com/drupal-training-workshops">New Orleans?</a>)  ChapterThree also has a<a href="http://chapterthree.com/training"> schedule</a> online.</p>
<p>For a larger group you might want to consider private training.  That is, having a trainer or two come to your company and do one or more courses with your team.  It's likely cheaper than sending the entire team across the country and most training companies will provide this service.  Drupal.org keeps a list of companies offering training services <a href="http://drupal.org/training-services">here</a>.</p>
Documentation
<p>With 13,000+ modules available for Drupal, you'd think there would be 13,000 detailed and articulate usage and how-to documents available, right?  Well not quite, but there are plenty of written docs out there.  Never for the module YOU need though it seems.   Being a community-sourced project, Drupal has highly-variable quality and quantity of docs.  But there are a few good places to find them:</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/documentation">drupal.org/documentation</a> : the <em>home base</em> for general Drupal docs.  You can find guides for <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/understand">Understanding</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/install">Installing</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/build">Sitebuilding</a> with Drupal, detailed developer and API guides, code chunks, video, slide decks, and much more.  This is community documentation, which means you can add and edit it as well.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/readdoc.png" width="200" height="181" alt="readdoc.png" href="http://drupal.org/project/seotools" /><a href="http://drupal.org/forum">drupal.org/forum</a> : With 137,000 topics and half a million posts in the first forum alone, the Drupal.org Forum is a busy place. And filled with useful information. <a href="http://drupal.org/search/apachesolr_search">Search the site</a> first before posting a new question, and be sure to read through the <a href="http://drupal.org/forum-posting">hints</a> before you do anything else.</p>
<p>individual projects : many individual modules and themes have a "Read Documentation" link embedded right on its project page.  Again, community sourced, your mileage may vary. Some projects have entire mini-sites dedicating to helping you with implementation and usage, other projects have zippo.  Community means you can add to the docs - please do!</p>
Blogs
<p>Like web blogging in general, there's lots of great Drupal blog posts out there, and lots of abandoned blogs.  First off are a couple of aggregators you could start with:</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/planet">drupal.org/planet</a> : Planet Drupal aggregates 417 "broadly appealing, Drupal-related blog posts pertaining to the community at large".  The front page changes frequently, so be sure to check it 40-50 times a day.  Your boss will understand.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupalfire.com">drupalfire.com</a> : Same idea as Planet Drupal, but with few hundred title links on the front page, rather than a down-the-page teaser view. Does not cover as many blogs, but they are all generally high quality.</p>
<p>As for individual and Drupal shop bloggers, you should definitely be following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our Leader, Dries : <a href="http://buytaert.net">buytaert.net</a></li>
<li>The Drupal XO, Angie : <a href="http://webchick.net">webchick.net</a></li>
<li>Merlin of Chaos : <a href="http://angrydonuts.com">angrydonuts.com</a></li>
<li>Eric London : <a href="http://thedrupalblog.com">thedrupalblog.com</a></li>
<li>Chapter Three : <a href="http://www.chapterthree.com/blog">chapterthree.com/blog</a></li>
<li>Lullabot : <a href="http://lullabot.com/ideas/blog">lullabot.com/ideas/blog</a></li>
<li>LevelTen : <a href="http://leveltendesign.com/blog">leveltendesign.com/blog</a>  (oh come on, I had to!)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Broco Magi says that's enough for Part 2, so we'll give you some time to check out all these great resources.  We will look at books, podcasts, videos, and more in Part 3 and beyond.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://drupal.org/security-team">Drupal Security Team</a> was originally created in 2005. Though we handled security issues before that, we didn't have a team with proper infrastructure until then. At that time, <a href="http://drupal4hu.com/">Károly Négyesi</a> (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/9446">chx</a>) was the team leader. In July 2006 chx changed his role in the team and I promoted <a href="http://drupal.org/node/75852">Heine Deelstra to be the security team lead</a>. Heine recently stepped down as the security team lead, and I'm pleased to announce that <a href="http://knaddison.com">Greg Knaddison</a> (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/36762">greggles</a>) will be filling this role.</p>
<p>Greg has been a consistent member of the security team and both Heine Deelstra, the security team members, and myself unanimously agreed that Greg is the logical person to head the Drupal Security Team.</p>
<p>For those who don't know Greg, Greg helped write <a href="http://drupal.org/writing-secure-code">our free handbooks on security</a> and wrote <a href="http://crackingdrupal.com/">a book about Drupal Security</a>.  He has also talked about security and Drupal at many DrupalCons. Greg believes in my idea to <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-security-team-past-current-and-future">automate where possible and empower project maintainers</a>. In the coming weeks he will write blog posts to detail some changes made in the last year toward that vision and some tasks that still remain.</p>
<p>As the Drupal Security Team lead, Greg will be the point person for the team. He'll be responsible for coordinating the security team's activities and for making decisions when consensus doesn't arise.</p>
<p>Greg and I agreed on a target of 2 years for him to be in this role.  If appropriate, he may continue in this role longer or be replaced before then, but this target helps to set an expectation about the time period. Setting this expectation should help Greg maintain enthusiasm for this role and increase the likelihood that our community will have continuity when that time is up.  Greg works at Acquia and will be given 20% of his time to dedicate to the security team (in addition to using his own spare time).</p>
<p>Please join me in thanking Heine for all the great work he did, and in welcoming Greg.</p>  </div>

      <a href="/aggregator/sources/1" class="feed-item-source">Ultimas noticias do drupal</a> -
      <span class="feed-item-date">Seg, 14/11/2011 - 21:35</span>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    
        <p><img src="http://openconcept.ca/sites/openconcept.ca/files/government_of_canada_prototype.png" alt="New CLF 3.0" width="300" height="232" /></p>
<p class="p1">OpenConcept has been participating working in the work of building a Drupal theme for the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/clf2-nsi2/">Treasury Board Secretariat's Common Look &amp; Feel (CLF)</a> for a number of years now.  We started distributing one in 2008 based on the Zen theme &amp; Drupal 6.  It was pretty simple and relied on a great many modules to be downloaded &amp; configured before it would work as expected.  We didn't get many contributions to improve the theme after providing it to a number of departments we and releasing it on IRCan, so we didn't invest much more in it.  At the very least it needed an <a title="Drupal Install Profiles" href="http://drupal.org/node/306267">install profile</a> to allow the basic configurations to be set up so that it would be easier to get started.  </p>
<p class="p1">Then the CLF Office brought us in to look at the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/clf2-nsi2/tb-bo/td-dt/wet-boew-eng.asp">Web Experience Toolkit (WET)</a>. Admittedly, at first I wasn't a big fan, but the big picture initially presented by the CLF Office has become much more realistic in the last few months. A great deal of work has gone into improving &amp; testing the code presented by <a href="http://tbs-sct.ircan-rican.gc.ca/projects/gcwwwtemplates">WET on IRCan</a>.  I love both that this framework is "Unless otherwise noted, computer program source code of the Web Experience Toolkit (WET) iscovered under Crown Copyright, Government of Canada, and is distributed under the MIT License." I think it's equally brialliant that the team behind this is reaching out to the Government of Ontario, Australia &amp; is actively working to collaborate with other organizations to strengthen this framework. </p>

<p class="p1">However, simply having a open source license doesn't mean that people or departments will devote any time or effort to doing so.  Fortunately an innovative team at Statistics Canada is pushing forward with an extremely promising initiative that promises to meet the needs of many departments struggling to meet <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">WCAG 2.0 AA requirements</a>. As with any community driven initiative you need at least one core member with a strong vision to push ideas and keep a project moving.  </p>
<p class="p1">The theme developed by StatsCan is using the Government of Canada's new Standard on Web Usability. This theme was only officially released earlier this month, so it is great that there is a solid implementation already available with a free software license. The theme is also an extension of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/genesis">Drupal theme Genesis</a>, which has done more than any other Drupal 7 theme to meet accessibility requirements. This allows for the new WET theme to be more closely tied to <em>the Drupal way</em>, which will reduce costs &amp; increase security. </p>
<p class="p1">Now StatsCan didn't develop this in isolation and worked with the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">RCMP</a>, <a href="http://openplus.ca/">OpenPlus</a>, <a href="http://www.liquidcms.ca/">LiquidCMS</a> &amp; <a href="http://openconcept.ca/">OpenConcept</a> to produce a very good Beta implementation. It's going to need greater contributions from other government departments who are already using Drupal or who are seriously considering deploying it.  This shouldn't simply be within the federal government, and hopefully the Government of Ontario is able to start contributing more as they start launching more sites with this platform (a big site is about to be launched soon I understand). It takes more collaboration to make this as robust as I'd like to see it. </p>
<p class="p1">The core structure of this is based on the recommended HTML5 version WET which has undergone a considerable testing.  There are also a number of jQuery widgets which are recommended by the WET community.  As stated in the <a href="http://tbs-sct.ircan-rican.gc.ca/projects/gcwwwtemplates/wiki/WET_Fact_Sheet">fact sheet</a>, "A new version of WET will be released every six months to keep pace with technological change, add new features and enhance existing features." This committment to keeping up with technological change &amp; ensuring that this is an evolving best practice is critical. The <a href="http://tbs-sct.ircan-rican.gc.ca/projects/gcwwwtemplates/wiki/WET_timeline">next release of WET is in February</a>, and this will include two months of beta testing of the code &amp; the <a href="http://tbs-sct.ircan-rican.gc.ca/projects/gcwwwvar">framework variants</a> (what different CMS specific expressions are being called).</p>
<p class="p1">Although the mobile &amp; Intranet standards have yet to be released, the Drupal community is already very well prepared to serve up interactive content to both. Drupal's always been flexible enough to deliever an organization's Internet site, campaign specific sites, as well as Intranet sites.  There is also considerable interest in the mobile space within the Drupal community. There are many modules and themes available to work with and a community that is working hard to establish best practices with this rapidly moving technology.  Simply starting with HTML5 will ensure that mobile sites will be better served, but there are a number of jQuery libraries (<a href="http://jqtouch.com/">jQTouch</a> &amp; <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQueryMobile</a> being the big ones) which are being built which can be used to extend Drupal.  </p>
<p class="p1">When these get released it shouldn't take too much more time to have additional themes developed for for use. Having one piece of software that can be used for many different functions will substantially reduce costs for different departments. The training costs alone will present a significant savings, especially since there have been so many usability improvements in Drupal 7. </p>
<p class="p1">Being built with Drupal 7 is a huge advantage.  The accessibility enhancements that have been built into Drupal 7 put this CMS far ahead of the competition when you need to meet WCAG 2.0 AA compliance.  This will be the platform for government website development, and will be able to serve adopters for the next 5 years.  This is the right time to adopt Drupal and take advantage of the estimated <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/p/drupal/estimated_cost">$8 million dollars</a> of development that have gone into Drupal core. </p>
<p class="p1">It makes it easy for new users to set up a site to evaluate Drupal and provides experts with a great starting point to begin the actual customizations required for the client. If you're interested in finding out more about this, consider registering for the <a href="http://a11yyow.ca/">A11yYOW Unconference</a> where William Hearn will be presenting it.  If you aren't able to attend the December 2nd conference, please contact us and I can arrange to provide an overview of our sandbox implementation.part of what is being developed. There's work on ensuring that internationalization is properly set up to meet the federal governments bilingual requirements.  There's also a number of other modules which have been added to ensure proper workflow, security &amp; usability.  It's a strong enough base that we are starting to use the new StatsCan profile in a number of non-government contracts. The install profile &amp; related features provide a 5 minute install to a powerful, very accessible, bilingual CMS that's built to meet the needs of many organizations. </p>

<p>We've been offering CiviCRM consulting and hosting on a per-client basis for some time now, and as we have grown, we have started to feel the need for greater automation and consistency in our hosting offerings and contracts. Koumbit is currently in the midst of developing a comprehensive hosted CiviCRM offering, with the support of a few courageous clients.</p>
<p>On the technical side our solution is intimately linked to the Drupal frontend and the <a href="http://www.aegirproject.org">Aegir hosting system</a>. The aegir hosting system is primarily designed to host multi-site drupals. Once configured on a server, aegir handles many aspects of site deployment, from database creation to virtual host configuration. It also allows for the easy cloning of existing sites and the migration of sites from one Drupal codebase to another. At Koumbit we use Aegir to partially automate minor and security updates of Drupal and CiviCRM.</p>
<p>Koumbit has participated in the development of Aegir since before it was called Aegir, and at the time of this writing we host several dozen client sites on our own Aegir servers, as well as supporting a handful of aegir vservers for developers and resellers. It was natural for us to extend the system to provide better support for CiviCRM, and the results of our efforts have been published to drupal.org as <a href="http://drupal.org/project/provision_civicrm">provision_civicrm</a>.</p>
<p>On the business side we are balancing several competing, but complementary, concerns. Hardware costs, maintenance and support time all have to be factored into the cost. At the same time, we want our offering to be competitive with comparable hosted CRM offerings, and want to meet high standards of reliability, uptime, and customer support. Finally, on a long-term perspective, we are still exploring the potential of this service as a turn-key hosted solution.</p>
Our User Base
<p>The majority of Koumbit's customers come from Québec's non-profit sector. This community has a number of concerns that directly affect our work and choices when it comes to CiviCRM.</p>
Language
<p>The most obvious challenge in our work with this clientelle is language. The majority of our clients and workers speak French as a first language. However, in Canada and Québec, most membership organisations must provide services and materials in both official languages. Multilingual websites are the norm, and the transition from one language to the other must be smooth, complete, and easy.</p>
<p>I don't think it is controversial to assert that English is the most prevelant language in use for documentation and discussion in the FLOSS community. This demands a daily extra effort on the part of our mostly French-speaking developers to participate, patch, and report issues, as well as find solutions for their problems. It also means that we must often write our own documentation and create our own trainings rather than point our clients to existing resources.</p>
<p>This challenge is of course an enormous opportunity for us as well, and in recent years Koumbit has expanded it's training offering, with an introductory <a href="https://services.koumbit.org/fr/node/18">CiviCRM training</a> in French in the pipeline for January 2012.</p>
Technology
<p>CRMs are a relative newcomer on the Québec landscape. Many organisations, sprung up from the grassroots, have used the most readily available solutions to keep track of their membership and contacts. Over the years we have seen Access databases, Outlook address books, Excel spreadsheets, and a host of scratch solutions.</p>
<p>Our own preference for Mailman as a mailing list manager has also recently come on the table, as a client has asked to us to allow them to manage their Mailman discussion lists via the same CiviCRM interfaces they use to send mass mailings.</p>
<p>Koumbit's own CiviCRM is a case in point. Our CiviCRM contains imports from a Mailman list, our client list in LedgerSMB, and hosting accounts from our old shared hosting system, AlternC. Managing and synching these disparate data sources is a significant technical and logistical challenge.</p>
Budgets and Financing
<p>Québec non-profits face a particularly convoluted funding landscape. Private donors are few and far between, and conservative in their approach to funding projects, if not in their outright politics. Federal, provincial and municipal funding programs exist, but require applications in different languages. Every time there is a change in government, programs are cut and new programs are opened. Project funding is the norm, with funds offered on a limited period of time and for clear deliverables, often with the requirement that the funded organisation source a portion of the project costs elsewhere.</p>
<p>In this environment small donations and membership drives of the kind that CiviCRM can facilitate are particularly crucial to long-term organisational health, and are presently becoming more central to most organisation's funding strategies. If we can provide an affordable and dependable solution for this kind of fund-raising, Koumbit and its clients will reap the benefits.</p>
Case Studies
<p>At Koumbit we know that client's needs and means can differ wildly. We typically experiment with new offerings by negotiating custom hosting and maintenance contracts with existing clients. Here is a brief description of one of our existing hosted CiviCRM contracts, which we are using to develop a final set of prices and services for our offering.</p>
Réseau québécois des groupes écologistes
<p>The <a href="http://www.rqge.qc.ca/">RQGE</a> asked us about CiviCRM after meeting with a company offering a proprietary solution and checking out some <a href="http://www.ebase.org/">other open source options</a>. We offered them a $900 a year contract for hosted CiviCRM. The contract included their existing hosting, updates to their Drupal site and their new CiviCRM installation, and one hour of support a month.</p>
<p>Rather than have us migrate their contact database, RQGE chose to have an intern sift the database and enter data into the CiviCRM by hand, in order to allow them to iron out the inconsistencies that had built up over the years. This work is currently ongoing.</p>
<p>This contract has pushed us to identify a panoply of issues affecting CiviCRM in the Aegir/Drupal environment, from  well-known <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/admin_menu?text=civicrm&amp;status=All">administration menu issues</a> to problems with CiviCRM's templates and temporary files directory.</p>
You?
<p>This is a beta service. As such we are open to adding new clients to our roster who are both serious about investing in a hosted CRM solution and willing to help us improve our offering. Please <a href="http://www.koumbit.org/en/contact">get in touch</a> if you are interested.</p>
Technical Notes
<p>The meat, potatoes, tofu and organic kale of Koumbit is and has always been website development. As a primarily Drupal shop we have developed considerable expertise with hosting php, MySQL and a host of related services. Desjardins, the province's federation of credit unions, recognises us as an e-commerce service provider, and this also brings considerable business to our door.</p>
<p>Three key issues have thus come up for us time and again as we and our clients have adopted CiviCRM: hosting and maintenance, translation and language, and payment processing.</p>
Aegir integration (provision_civicrm)
<p>The Aegir hosting system is divided into two parts. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/hostmaster">Hostmaster</a> is the frontend - a drupal site to manage drupals. In the backend we have <a href="http://drupal.org/project/provision">Provision</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a>. We maintain <a href="http://debian.aegirproject.org/">Debian packages</a> for Aegir in order to simplify our deployments, and instructions for installing from those packages are available on the the <a href="http://community.aegirproject.org/installing/debian">Aegir community site</a>.</p>
<p>provision_civicrm was first written during the CiviCRM codesprint following the San Francisco CiviCon in 2010. Since then we have refined and expanded it, as the module has passed through several hands. It is not a one-size fits all solution. provision_civicrm is intended for small and medium sized systems (think thousands of contacts, and not hundreds of thousands) and supports only the Drupal frontend of CiviCRM.</p>
<p>provision_civicrm makes a number of assumptions, in its current form, that are helpful to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>A site created on a drupal codebase with civicrm in it is a civicrm site.</li>
<li>The CiviCRM database and the Drupal database are one and the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the Aegir concept of the Drupal codebase as a "platform", this works for us as a way to manage all of our CiviCRM sites on the same platform. "Ordinary" Drupal sites live on one or more seperate platforms. CiviCRM updates and upgrades are handled by the Aegir migration and cloning features.</p>
<p>We use LDAP, file acls, and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/provisionacl">provisionacl</a> to manage client and developer access to different sites. One of our current challenges is to ensure that <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1328464">provisionacl and provision_civicrm talk to each other</a>.</p>
Payment gateways (Desjardins and Moneris)
<p>We have tried a number of approaches to managing payments with CiviCRM and our client's preferred payment gateways. One memorable hack relied on the Ubercart Drupal e-commerce module to process and receive payments and update CiviCRM accordingly. Presently we are working on integration of both Desjardins and Moneris with CiviCRM's built-in payment system.</p>
Translation and multi-lingual issues
<p>Koumbit has contributed many hours to CiviCRM's translation and multilingual management, including a partial translation (sadly, no longer online) of the <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/CiviCRM/">CiviCRM book</a>, and a multitude of patches to CiviCRM and to the Drupal suite of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/i18n">internationalization modules</a>.</p>  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>The Apachesolr module (7.x) allows us to build sites that use powerful search technology. Besides being blazingly fast, Apachesolr has another advantage: faceted search.</p>
<p>Faceted search allows our search results to be filtered by defined criteria like category, date, author, location, or anything else that can come out of a field. We call these criteria <em>facets</em>. With facets, you can narrow down your search more and more until you get to the desired results.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the standard functionality is not enough. You might want or need to customize the way that facets work. This is controlled by <a href="http://drupal.org/project/facetapi">Facet API</a>. Unfortunately there is not much documentation for Facet API, and the API can be difficult to understand.</p>
<p>This post will change that!</p>
<p>In this post, you will learn how to use FacetAPI to create powerful custom faceted searches in Drupal 7. I will take a look at the UI of the module as well as its internals, so that we can define our own widgets, filters, and dependencies using some cool ctools features.</p>

Just mouse over the entity in a list, and you'll get a dropdown menu of contextual options. Adding your own custom links to an entity's context menus, however, can't be done out-of-the-box. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ccl">Custom Contextual Links</a> changes that; it allows you to add any link to the context drop-down for supported entity types!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lullabot.com/sites/lullabot.com/files/ccl-admin.png" class="fancy" alt="Screenshot of the Custom Contextual Links administration screen" /></p>
<p>Setting up Custom Contextual Links is easy. The module adds its own screen to the administrative configuration section. Adding a new link gives you a set of simple options to control the link's title, destination URL, and where it should appear. For now, it supports adding links to specific blocks, all blocks, specific nodes, specific node types, and all nodes simultaneously. It's a little detail, but the module's administration UI does a good job of hiding unnecessary options using Drupal 7's new States API.</p>

This helps someone reading your code quickly see that the function is actually linked with a hook in Drupal and isn't just a function in your module to be called directly.</p>

<p>But&hellip; Well&hellip; The thing is&hellip; Does anyone else get bored of writing the following over and over again? I know do&hellip;</p>

/**
 * Implements hook_menu().
 */

<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could just type in "menu" and Vim could just fill it our for you? Here follows a little Vim script for inserting a "hook implements" comment at the current cursor position.
function! DrupalImplementsComment(hook)
  set paste
&nbsp;
  exe &quot;normal! i/**\&lt;CR&gt;&quot;
  \          . &quot; * Implements hook_&quot; . a:hook . &quot;()\&lt;CR&gt;&quot;
  \          . &quot; */\&lt;Esc&gt;&quot;

endfunction
&nbsp;
map &lt;C-C&gt;&lt;C-C&gt;&lt;C-C&gt; :call DrupalImplementsComment(input(&quot;Enter Hook name:&quot;))&lt;CR&gt;

<p>Wherever your cursor is, press Ctrl+C 3 times, you then get prompted to enter the hook name. When you press enter, a comment gets inserted. Hopefully this will save someone some time - its already saving me time!</p>

<p>To install the script, I just have it in a file called DrupalCommenting.vim inside my ~/.vim/ folder. Then, inside my ~/.vimrc file, I have a line which imports the source file, eg: so ~/.vim/DrupalCommenting.vim.</p>

<p>Any improvements very welcome!</p>  </div>

    Drupal/Salesforce Integration

<p>DesignHammer completed a major Salesforce project this year which involved restructuring a client's Drupal/Salesforce integration. The client was using a forked, hacked-apart version of the Salesforce module from 2009 along with a custom implementation of Salesforce Outbound Messaging to do bidirectional syncing of 30,000 Drupal user accounts.</p>

<p>Our initial work involved replacing the forked module with the latest stable release of the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/salesforce">Drupal Salesforce module</a>, and we put a significant amount of time into <a href="http://www.designhammer.com/blog/improving-drupal-integration-salesforce">submitting and reviewing patches for the project</a>.</p>

Problems importing the Salesforce records

<p>After the initial work was completed, the client increased the number of Lead/Contact records in SF to 100,000. 75% of those required syncing with Drupal. This caused problems.</p>

<p>The first issue we encountered was the frequency of updates. Every 24 hours, a nightly processing script in Salesforce runs updates on all records, and can affect anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of Contact/Lead records.</p>

<p>Outbound Messaging, which provides real time updates of data from Salesforce to Drupal, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1127166">moves too fast for Drupal to be able to send back a response acknowledging the message</a>, so the Outbound Messaging queue in Salesforce would quickly fill up and fail. After some consideration, we switched the import implementation to SF Import, a module that is responsible for polling Salesforce for updates in a two part process: grabbing all the Salesforce IDs that have changed since the last poll, and then processing these IDs by passing them through sf_user_import().</p>

<p>But we quickly ran into a new problem, processing the data. Processing is triggered by cron which is limited by PHP's max_execution_time setting. In this case the time limit was 2 minutes. After that, the queue would sit idle until the next cron run 28 minutes later. This meant that, at best, we were only processing a few hundred records per day. The import queue quickly filled up to more than 110,000 items.</p>

Cutting the Salesforce import down to size

<p>To start approaching the problem, we first looked at what could be done to improve the efficiency of the import process. For one thing, we noticed that about 30-40% of the records stored in {sf_import_queue} were failing on import, because they lacked an e-mail address. These records were never meant to sync with Salesforce, so they could be removed from the queue. We wrote a drush script to go through the queue, look up the corresponding record in Salesforce, and if the record did not have an e-mail address, we deleted it from the queue.</p>

<p>Then we looked at preventing these records from syncing in the first place. The SF Import module was using an implementation of the Salesforce API's getUpdated() method, which returns SFIDs for all records of a given type between two time points. We committed a patch to <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1313666">allow using SOQL queries instead of getUpdated</a> which gave us more flexibility in this process. We used this with our own hand written query which checks for an e-mail address when selecting SFIDs to import. This reduced the overall size of the queue by about 40%.</p>

Using drushd for processing

<p>Once we were able to limit the size of the queue we looked for a way to process the queue more efficiently. The major problem with relying on cron is that we were limited by max_execution_time. We experimented with increasing cron frequency but that wasn't enough. We needed to be able to process records from the queue continually.</p>

<p>We looked at a few different options for doing that and settled on <a href="https://drupal.org/project/drushd">drushd</a>, a library for creating daemonized drush commands. Using this library, we were able to create a Salesforce Import Process daemon that listens for additions to the sf_import_queue table and can process them continually. This was a much more efficient way to process the queue.</p>

<p>drushd will occasionally reach a high level of memory usage. If it reaches 85% of the total PHP memory limit it is supposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(operating_system)">refork</a> and continue processing. However, we weren't able to get this working correctly, instead the script just dies. So, we wrote a simple module that implements hook_cron(). The module checks to see if the process ID for the import daemon is still active, and if it isn't, it starts the daemon up again.</p>

<p>Using this method we are able to consistently handle tens of thousands of imports from Salesforce Contacts/Leads to Drupal users every day without a significant hit on performance or responsiveness on the site.</p>

<p>Check out the code for the <a href="https://github.com/DesignHammer/Salesforce-Import-Process-Daemon">daemon and module on DesignHammer's Github</a> and let us know what you think. If you've approached this problem from a different angle please let us know in the comments section.</p>
