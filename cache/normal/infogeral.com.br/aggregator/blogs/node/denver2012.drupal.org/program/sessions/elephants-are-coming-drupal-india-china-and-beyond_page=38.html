    There are more flavors of browsers out there than coffee choices at your local Starbucks.  I may not be 100% correct on that statement, but toss in browsers resolutions and the different operating systems that people are viewing on and the numbers are quite close.  <br />

&quot;Can I get a firefox 3.5 on OSX with my 1440 x 900 resolution to go?&quot; <br />

    <p>Since I am among other things, a member of the <a href="https://drupal.org/security-team" rel="nofollow">Drupal security team</a>, I sometimes get contacted about the security of particular modules or sites.</p>
<p>Today was such a day. A Drupal site developer had some suspicions about a contrib module being unsafe, since three of his clients' sites got "hacked". I asked about the symptoms and was told that a call to an advertising site got inserted into index.php.</p>
<p>This fact alone told me two things:</p>
<p>1) It is not Drupal specific; index.php is used by many PHP applications.</p>

    <p>Modern web browsers put a cap on the number of connections they make to a host. This means if you've got a lot of assets on one hostname the browser will queue the remaining assets, while the ones in front download. This is referred to as blocking. </p>
<p>One way around blocking is to create multiple subdomains, for instance, assets0.davidstoline.com and assets1.davidstoline.com to increase the number of resources downloaded in parallel. This is method is called domain sharding and it is recommended by both Google's PageSpeed and Yahoo's YSlow.</p>
<p>I can't exactly afford a high quality CDN like <a href="http://www.akamai.com">Akamai</a> but I can still leverage some of the benefits and fun of using a CDN. My friend <a href="http://wimleers.com">Wim Leers</a> wrote the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cdn">Drupal CDN module</a>, which you can leverage to do a little home grown sharding of your own.</p>
<p>In my nginx configuration for davidstoline.com I added...<br />
&nbsp; server_name assets0.davidstoline.com;<br />&nbsp; server_name assets1.davidstoline.com;</p>
<p>Then in my Drupal sites directory I created two new directories for assets0.davidstoline.com and assets1.davidstoline.com with a settings file that looks like<br />
&lt;?php<br />die();<br />?&gt;</p>
<p>I set it up to die(); because  I don't actually want to serve my site from those two subdomains.</p>
<p>Boom! Now you just configure the CDN module to use those two subdomains. Just download, install and enable Wim's CDN module. Visit admin/config/development/cdn/details and add something like<br />
http://assets0.davidstoline.com|.css<br />http://assets1.davidstoline.com</p>
<p>And you're set. You may want to tweak your CDN module setup if you serve a lot of image assets.</p>

    <p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/devel" title="Devel | drupal.org">The Devel module</a> includes the super helpful <a href="http://krumo.sourceforge.net/">Krumo library</a>. I use dsm() and krumo() all the time. If you are not familiar with Devel, you should try it. Morten Wulff wrote a <a href="https://ratatosk.backpackit.com/pub/1836982-debugging-drupal">demo page for the module</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://naxoc.net/files/naxoc.net/krumo.png" alt="krumo" /></p>
<p>Today a client suggested that the Devel module Krumo could display the "path" to an item in an array by right clicking or otherwise interacting with the nested elements in the output from Krumo. I was really excited about that idea - I can't count the number of times I have tried and failed to target an item deep in a form array or an item in the node object simply because my human brain can't remember a structure like $form['#node']-&gt;content['links']['comment']['#attributes']['class'] for more than 3 seconds.</p>
<p>Still very happy with this new idea I went straight home and started to hack away at the Krumo library to make it display the path to a desired item. After looking at the javascript for a while, and saying out loud that Javascript hates me, I realized that the killer feature I was trying to make already exists in Krumo! This is a well hidden gem that I haven't seen before today, so I thought I would share it:<br />
If you double click an item in the Krumo output it prints the items array "path" so that you can copy paste it into your code and stop worrying about remembering long array structures.</p>

<p>Mega Menus have become all the rage in navigation user inteface. When you have a large list of items for a dropdown menu a mega menu makes an efficient way to display the list.&nbsp; An excellent example of a mega menu is on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">the White House&#39;s website</a>.</p>

    <p>On June 2, the big three search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Bing) announced Schema.org, which helps them show search results in a more useful way. The <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2011/07/on-june-2-nd-we-announced-collaboration.html">announcement</a> has gotten people really interested in inline structured data such as microdata and RDFa.</p>
<p>This screencast shows how you can use the microdata module to place Schema.org terms. This is an early preview—very few field formatters have microdata support at this time and the module is still changing quite a bit—but I thought people might be interested in the direction the module is heading.</p>

<p>Three weeks ago, at DrupalCon London, I gave my traditional State of Drupal presentation. In good tradition, you can <a href="http://buytaert.net/files/state-of-drupal-august-2011.pdf">download a copy of my slides</a> (PDF, 37 MB) or you can <a href="http://blip.tv/drupalcon/keynote_dries_web_export-5492941">watch a video recording of my keynote</a>.  In my presentation, I talk a lot about Drupal 8 and some of the things that matter to the many Drupal users.</p>
<p>My presentation was based on the results of the <a href="http://buytaert.net/state-of-drupal-2011-survey">State of Drupal survey</a>, which got over 3,000 responses from people all over the world. Because I didn't have time to talk about all the survey questions in my keynote, I've decided to make <a href="http://buytaert.net/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2011-summary.pdf">a summary of all the survey results</a> (PDF, 160 KB) available as well. It gives a more complete view on the survey results.</p>
<p>However, there is much more data hidden in the raw survey results, so if you'd like to do your own analysis, you can <a href="http://buytaert.net/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2011-raw.xls">download a copy of the raw survey results</a> (<a href="http://buytaert.net/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2011-raw.csv">CSV format</a> or <a href="http://buytaert.net/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2011-raw.xls">XLS format</a>) and look at the raw data yourself.  I anonymized the data by removing the name and company information. If you decide to analyze the raw data, consider sharing your findings with all of us.</p>

    <p>I posted this video a couple of weeks ago but didn't get a chance to write it up. It demonstrates building a module that creates a view using SPARQL on whatever site it is installed on.</p>
<p>If you provide a dataset and it is available with SPARQL, this can be a really great way to help people understand how to use your data. Because users who install the module can use the Views user interface to alter the view that is created, it can be a great starting point for experimentation by users who don't know so much about your data or building views.</p>

<p>A lot of people have expressed desires to get involved with core, but don't exactly know where to start. If you are one of those people, this post is for you! Here are three helpful tips.
</p>
#drupal-contribute
<p>If you can, hang out on IRC in the #drupal-contribute channel on freenode (IRC blocked? Try this handy <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">webchat IRC</a>). This is where most of the "action" is regarding day-to-day core development conversation, before it makes its way into the issue queue. It's a great way to stay up to speed on initiatives that are happening and opportunities to pitch in, as well as get to know better some of the faces behind the software you use daily. :)</p>
Core Office Hours
<p>Tuesday, 04:00 - 06:00 UTC <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2011&amp;mo=8&amp;d=9&amp;h=4&amp;mn=0">(convert this to my timezone)</a> and Wednesday, 16:00 - 18:00 UTC <a href="http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_UTC.aspx?y=2011&amp;mo=8&amp;d=10&amp;h=16&amp;mn=0">(convert this to my timezone)</a>, there are <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1242856">Core Office Hours</a>, which is time specifically set aside where core development team members are around to answer any questions you might have about getting started, and to recommend things to work on. This isn't just code stuff either: writing issue summaries, testing fixes, and even doing basic triage are all really helpful as well!</p>
"Novice" issues
<p>There is a list of issues that are short and quick, "low hanging fruit" kind of tasks that have been tagged as <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?status%5B%5D=Open&amp;issue_tags=Novice">Novice</a>. These are the perfect issues to cut your teeth on if you're looking for something small to start on before you rise to your inevitable rockstar greatness!</p>
<p>Hope to see you in the queue and in IRC! :D</p>

    <p>Ever use Drupal or Drupal.org and come across some kind of minor, annoying issue... say a typo, or a code comment that could stand to be improved, or some other change that's only a couple of lines of code... and you think to yourself, "Self, this would take you about 5 minutes to fix, but your to-do list is 43.4 km long. Pass."</p>
<p>Well, the next time that happens, please pause for a moment, and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/add/project-issue">file an issue</a> for that minor problem, and tag it as "Novice".</p>
<p>Thanks to the efforts of brand-new contributor <a href="http://drupal.org/user/1327098">demarcoz</a>, we rolled out a new Drupal.org improvement this week: a link to the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search?projects=&amp;status%5B%5D=Open&amp;issue_tags=Novice">queue of all Novice issues</a>! (which was itself a Novice issue: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1266380" title="http://drupal.org/node/1266380">http://drupal.org/node/1266380</a> :))</p>
<p><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110914-c7f6t5rw7rfg5hm42du151c7p9.png" alt="New novice link in the dashboard" /></p>
<p>The goal of the "Novice" tag is to help identify "low-hanging fruit" issues. This way, people who haven't been using Git and rolling patches since they were in diapers can have something bite-sized to chew on while they work their way up the learning curve of setting up a development environment, figuring out quirky git commands, and finding their way around Drupal coding standards and API peculiarities. This is a much nicer introduction to contributing than showing them an issue queue with 50,000 issues in it and saying "There ya go! Pick one that sounds interesting!" :)</p>
<p>And while it might take a new contributor a few days to solve something you could solve in a few minutes:</p>
<p>a) It's <em>really</em> fun to walk new people through this process and see what sorts of things trip new people up.<br />
b) They're now equipped to tackle even harder issues in the queue, and they can eventually help you with your own 43.4 km long todo list.<br />
c) They can also help improve documentation in places where they got stuck, and even help mentor other novices!</p>
<p>So the next time you find a small issue you could solve yourself in a few minutes, please <strong>don't!</strong> Instead, tag it as "Novice" and help to usher in a new crop of eager new contributors. :)</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://stevepurkiss.com/about">Drupal Consultant</a> I regularly explain what <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> is to business people, and with five million searches per month for "What is Drupal?" according to the <a href="">Google Keyword Tool</a>, one of Drupal's growing pains as it gains <a href="https://acquia.com/five-data-sheets-promoting-drupal">mass adoption</a> is communicating what exactly it is to a new, often non-technical audience.</p>
<p>Many have heard of blogging platform <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> however don't realise the power and flexibility of Drupal as a fully-featured Content Management System and Web Application Platform which just happens to have blogging functionality as part of its offering.</p>
The Opportunity
<p>Much of the existing marketing material available for Drupal is quite technical and often quickly out-of-date, so when I found out at <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/">DrupalCon London</a> that I had <a href="https://association.drupal.org/node/1569">won one of the first ever Drupal Community Cultivation Grants</a> to help promote the <a href="http://bad-ass.org.uk/">Drupal Discovery Day</a> I'm organising as part of the <a href="http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/">Brighton Digital Festival</a> I decided to enlist the help of local film makers <a href="http://larchmontfilms.com/">Larchmonth Films</a> and we made a short film!</p>
<p>We hope this video will help anyone who wants to explain what Drupal is from a fairly non-technical point of view - here's the final cut:</p>
<p></p>
Choosing a supplier
With only three weeks between the announcement of the grant and our <a href="http://bad-ass.org.uk/">Drupal Discovery Day</a> I decided to post on the <a href="http://wiredsussex.com/">Wired Sussex</a> projects board in order to solicit applications from the local community, however even with over 600 views of the project details after a week I only had a handful of replies and all were simply offering their services as leaflet designers. Perhaps it was the way I wrote the project brief but I was hoping for more 'out-of-the-box' thinking as all I had thought of at the time was creating a leaflet too and was looking for more of a <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/purple/">Purple Cow</a>.
 
Luckily my local friend and fellow Drupal developer <a href="http://www.wearehere.info/">Steve Liddell</a> contacted me and suggested creating a video as the best use of the budget - having recently bought a video camera I kicked myself as it was obvious that would be the best option! Unfortunately Steve was too busy to help at the time however I bumped into Philip Berman from <a href="http://larchmontfilms.com/">Larchmonth Films</a> at an event at <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/">The Lighthouse</a>, where we are holding our <a href="http://bad-ass.org.uk/">Drupal Discovery Day</a>, and he said he had a few days free to help out so I happily said yes. That was on the Friday a week after DrupalCon had finished and after a couple of chats over the weekend we started to film on the Monday.

Deciding on the content

Philip and I discussed a couple of ideas with regards to the content of the film - the original concept was that we were going to have people asking questions on the phone about functionality they needed and replies were "Drupal can do this". I felt this would be a bit too cheesey and potentially hard to create in the time we had. I was keen especially after <a href="http://buytaert.net/state-of-drupal-presentation-august-2011">Drupal founder Dries' the State of Drupal 2011 DrupalCon London Keynote</a> to target the message that Drupal's really great at replacing legacy systems and cutting IT costs.
 
Dries noted in his presentation that we shouldn't really be focusing on comparing to WordPress as we are both great open source projects - the real competition is the proprietary legacy systems many organisations have, and the fact that Drupal is the first system which can handle sites both small and large whereas previously you would use different products for small sites than you would for large ones. I was also keen to focus on the community angle, showing what we are building here in Brighton on the South coast of the UK.

Choosing the film stars

Philip charged me with the job of working out which three members would be able to provide the best information on our video. I chose <a href="http://twitter.com/guy_schneerson">Guy Schneerson</a> from <a href="http://www.blue-bag.com/">blue-bag ltd.</a> who is passionate about Drupal, develops Drupal sites, and maintains the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_stock">Drupal 7 Commerce Stock module</a>; <a href="http://twitter.com/kevelliott">Kevin Elliott</a>, Operations Director at <a href="http://www.whitehatmedia.com/">White Hat Media</a>, a local agency who work with clients including <a href="http://www.turner.com/">Turner Broadcasting</a>; and <a href="http://twitter.com/rocketgarden">Jack McAngus</a>, Head of Web Development <a href="http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/">Brighton &amp; Hove City Council</a> whom I have recently started providing consultancy to with regards to their adoption of Drupal.
 
I felt these three people showed Drupal from three different views which would appeal to our audience, and luckily they all agreed to help out and be filmed!
The filming
<p>I think Larchmont Films have managed to capture the spirit of the Drupal community and amazed at what they have created in such a short time - they certainly went out of their way and kindly did about twice the amount they would usually do for the budget we had available. Most was filmed during our twice-monthly Brighton Area Drupal Association meetup at our local tech community coworking space <a href="http://www.theskiff.org/">The Skiff</a>; some at the offices of <a href="http://www.whitehatmedia.com/">White Hat Media</a> and the rest apparently around Larchmont Films Philip Berman's neighbour's house!</p>
<p>We formalised the plan of action before our Drupal meeting and Philip along with the cameraman filmed Jack's interview whilst we waited for other members to turn up. Once the meeting started Kevin took the lead and we chose a few key words we were going to focus our discussions that night on - flexibiltiy, maturity, and so on. It was strange to have a camera crew there but we actually had a fantastic meeting as we wouldn't have normally discussed these subjects in such a general fashion, and after a while I almost forgot the film crew were there until they said "OK stop - repeat that" and suddenly I remembered we were in the making of a film! After our meeting Phil interviewed Guy and we went off down the pub as we always do to talk more Drupal.</p>
<p>I videod the evening and made a <a href="http://bad-ass.org.uk/video/bad-ass-video-the-making-of-trailer">little teaser movie which you can view here</a> - just as a little fun taster for those who had seen what we were up to and were hungry for more insight. Unfortunately I deleted the rest of the 'making of' film, so that will never be shown - fortunate some might say! The next day Philip went to Kevin's offices and interviewed him along with taking some great shots of the office and their other Drupal developers.</p>
The Editing
<p>All then went quiet for a couple of days whilst Philip worked with local video editor <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/loothi">Lucy Newman</a> who did a marvellous job of cutting down many hours of video into our lovely three minute short film. I had a quick look on the Thursday night, and after a couple of last-minute fixes we released the film online on the Friday, just four days after we started filming.</p>
The Promotion
Since we released the film I've been busy promoting it through our <a href="http://twitter.com/badassuk">Brighton Area Drupal Association</a> Twitter account, and helped by many re-tweets including <a href="http://twitter.com/Dries/status/113286067674808320">one from Drupal founder Dries</a> we've had over 1,000 views in the first five days alone which is awesome! I also took part in <a href="http://barcampbrighton.org">Barcamp Brighton</a> at the weekend and did a session to a packed room on the Saturday entitled "Free Software gave me money and I spent it on making a short film" which seemed to go down well, and I also played it a number of times including during my second session on Sunday "10 Reasons Drupal Sucks and Why You Shouldn't Use It", which will no doubt be one of my next blog posts!
 
Once our <a href="http://bad-ass.org.uk/">Drupal Discovery Day</a> is over we'll be uploading a version of the film without our event promoting card on the end so anyone else can use it for their own needs.

The Thanks

Of course none of this would have happened without: <a href="https://association.drupal.org/">The Drupal Association</a> and those who pay their membership so we can do projects like this; <a href="http://larchmontfilms.com/">Larchmonth Films</a> who have really gone out of their way to help us and created a timeless film; Guy, Kevin, and Jack for doing the interviews and the rest of our group who joined in the fun too. Last but not least of course thanks go to the Drupal community at large and Drupal founder Dries, both of whom without them we wouldn't be doing any of this!
 
We hope you like our little film, and do please spread the word where you can!

    Background Reading
<p>The purpose of this post isn't to explain the concept of responsive design.   There are many great resources out there that already do this, most notably <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design">Ethan Marcotte's article</a> on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com">A List Apart</a>.  Or better yet, read the <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">book</a>; it's a quick read and it's well worth it.</p>
<p>Nor is it my aim to debate the merits of responsive design.  I'm already convinced that this approach is beneficial, and, again, there are so many voices in the community arguing this point that I don't feel the need to chime in.</p>
<p>Instead, this post will discuss <a href="http://drupal.org/project/terrain">Terrain</a>, a specific <a href="http://drupal.org/project/hexagon">Hexagon</a>-based implementation of responsive design in Drupal.</p>
The Concept
<p>Both in principle and in practice, I don't like doing the same thing twice.  Why add this snippet of code to every new theme I create?</p>
img, iframe, video, embed { max-width: 100%; }
<p>
On one hand, every design is unique, and that is especially true when designing for multiple viewports and browser capabilities.  Because of this, <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/175234">"some recommend against using a base theme at all"</a>.  On the other hand, there is a set of design elements that can be generalized out to most responsive designs.  In Terrain, these elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger links for smaller viewports, making links easier to click on smaller touch devices</li>
<li>Max-width settings on images and other media</li>
<li>A Fluid grid</li>
<li>Single column layout on smaller viewports</li>
<li>Larger base font on larger viewports</li>
<li>Initial-scale settings to fix automatic resizing</li>
</ul>
<p>I've found that starting out with these basic elements saves time when creating a new responsive theme.  And with a starter theme in place for Terrain, it's easy to tailor the theme to your specific design.</p>
<p>This theme is also meant to give users a quick start to responsive design.  Fire it up, without changing any configuration settings, and you have a simple, usable, 100% responsive theme.</p>
Explaining Our Decisions
Why doesn't Terrain "respond" in Internet Explorer?
<p>Simply put, we made a deliberate decision not to implement IE support, despite the availability of javascript libraries such as <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design">adapt.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">respond.js</a> that were created for this purpose.</p>
<p>To borrow a quote from Jeffrey Zeldman's <a href="//www.alistapart.com/articles/tohell/">"To Hell With Bad Browsers"</a>:</p>
<p>For years, we’ve been taught to be good little web designers, building sites that work in browsers that don’t. Each site we build the old-fashioned way becomes one more dung heap of bad code, one more web destination that will eventually stop working as browsers and standards evolve.</p>
<p>The longer we do it, the more doomed sites proliferate. Thousands of new sites premiere every day. Most of them are built to support bad browsers intead of standards. It’s an epidemic. Enough already. We finally have good browsers. Let’s use them.</p>
<p>Even though this article was published in 2001, it still accurately summarizes my view on non-standards-compliant browsers.  This doesn't mean Terrain will be unusable or ugly on Internet Explorer 8 and below, it just means that IE8- won't have the benefit of being able to utilize some of the responsive features, i.e. <em>progressive enhancement</em> for more capable browsers.</p>
Why did you choose a fluid grid / responsive approach (as opposed to adaptive)?
<p>From an ideological perspective, I wanted my designs to be able to truly respond to their environments, as opposed to creating 3-5 similar designs to "fit" different classes of device.  This approach has several real-world advantages, from future-proofing against new sizes of tablets and other devices, to maximizing the use of (very) limited screen space on smartphones.</p>
<p>Of course there are also downsides with this method, like how much control you might have to concede over your pixel-perfect design.  So if having that kind of control over your design is important to you or your project, Terrain might not be a good fit.</p>
Why is Terrain based on Hexagon?
<p>If you haven't heard of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/hexagon">Hexagon</a>, I highly suggest you go download it and try it out.  Hexagon is a powerful base theme by the brilliant Joon Park (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/56782">dvessel</a>), with features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built-in plugin system, with available plugins for Accessible Tabs and Accessible Accordions regions, region grouping, 960.gs, module compatibility, smarter styles, and more</li>
<li>Granular separation of files, such as variable preprocess functions</li>
<li>Better file caching and overrides</li>
</ul>
<p>Building on this framework means Terrain can utilize all of Hexagon's features, while itself staying simple and lean.</p>
Why does Drupal need another responsive starter theme?
<p>Like most projects that appear to duplicate functionality, Terrain uses a slightly different approach.  None of the responsive starter themes we tried quite fit our needs, so we rolled our own solution.  As I mentioned above, we built Terrain to be extremely lean, while still leveraging the functionality of Hexagon.</p>
Future Improvements
<p>The first item on my Terrain to-do list is a 7.x version.  A close second is a set of usability improvements, including better documentation, a quickstart guide (for both Terrain and Hexagon), and more helpful comments.  Code improvements, such as more grid options and HTML5 support, extensible functionality, such as a responsive slideshow feature, and responsive image support are also coming soon.</p>
<p>Terrain is currently available for <a href="http://drupal.org/project/terrain">download</a> as a 6.x-1.0-alpha1 release on drupal.org.</p>  </div>
