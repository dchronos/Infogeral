    <p>You can do a lot of great things with field display in Drupal 7's 'manage display' tab for a content type. You can control the order and label position of each field attached to a node type in that tab for Full node displays, Teasers, and RSS displays (or other displays you set up).</p>
<p>However, there's no way to change certain aspects of a node's display inside an RSS Feed, such as the 'creator' tag, the 'link' tag, or the 'title' tag. For a <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/">news aggregation site</a> I run, I wanted to modify the &lt;link&gt; tag when displaying 'story' nodes, and make the link tag give an absolute URL to the original source instead of to my drupal site (so, instead of <a href="http://www.mysite.com/node/12">http://www.mysite.com/node/12</a>, it would go to <a href="http://www.example.com/original-story-url">http://www.example.com/original-story-url</a>).</p>
<p>A lot of blogs also use this kind of format for reposted blog items (such as <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a>), so users go straight to the source when they click on the title of an item in their RSS reader of choice. My method below can be modified to conditionally change a link if a field has a value (say, a 'RSS absolute URL' field or something like that).</p>
<p>For Drupal 6, some people had suggested using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_rss">Views RSS</a> for this purpose (it would let me manage a Views-provided feed display with fields instead of using Drupal's built-in node/teaser display), but this module doesn't have a stable D7 release, and it won't help me change things for Drupal's built in feeds.</p>
<p>For Drupal 7, all you need to do is implement <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules--node--node.api.php/function/hook_node_view/7">hook_node_view()</a> in a custom module, and change the $node-&gt;link value to whatever you want:</p>
&lt;?php<br />/**<br /> * Implements hook_node_view().<br /> *<br /> * For story nodes in RSS feeds, use field_story_url for link element.<br /> */<br />function custom_node_view($node, $view_mode, $langcode) {<br />  if ($node-&gt;type == 'story' &amp;&amp; $view_mode == 'rss') {<br />    $node-&gt;link = $node-&gt;field_story_url[$node-&gt;language][0]['url'];<br />  }<br />}<br />?&gt;
<p>Easy peasy. If you want to conditionally change the feed item &lt;link&gt; (say, only change the link value if $field_story_url has a value), change the line to:</p>
&lt;?php<br />    $node-&gt;link = (empty($node-&gt;field_story_url)) ? $node-&gt;link : $node-&gt;field_story_url[$node-&gt;language][0]['url'];<br />?&gt;
<p>You can also change things like $node-&gt;title to change what's in the RSS feed's &lt;title&gt; tag.</p>

    <p>One of the great things I've learned about the <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> community is, well, the community. They have these 'camps' all over the world, and more and more of them are videoing their sessions and putting them up all over the place on t'internet. It used to all be on <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> where I watched all the lovely drupalcon sessions, but now they're on loads of places, including the latest <a href="http://vimeo.com/drupalcampaustin">DrupalCamp Austin ones on Vimeo</a>. Here's some of the ones I watched this last weekend. It's how I get my fix of the drop, and makes me think about all the lovely places I have the opportunity _and_ excuse to go visit in 2012 like Denver in March and Barcelona in the summer for dev days ;) Yes, that's how exciting my life gets ;)</p>
<p>I think some of these are from the previous year - all so good I just got carried away!</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/32977204">Building Results web Projects</a></p>
<p>I actually used the method the presenter describes in a client session today I held at our lovely local coworking space <a href="http://theskiff.org">theskiff</a>. I've been working on a similar methodology but this guy hits the nail on the head when it comes to processes. Blue-sky projects I think waver a little on it from my experience today, but perhaps that may just be first time nerves!</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/33094244">Drupal SEO: Panel Q&amp;A with Volacci</a></p>
<p>Drupal's great at SEO and it's thanks to Volacci I know how to make the best use of it through their community contributions. I discovered you can even get a module which will show you how good your blog post is for SEO within Drupal itself. Maybe old news to you, sounds cool to me!</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/33083725">Apps Drupal Simplified</a></p>
<p>Download the LevelTen appstore. Trust me. Just do it. I'm not joking, it's the future. I sat there for at least half an hour just thinking about the possibliities for the future growth of Drupal, but then Eastenders came on the telly. No, seriously, it is the future and it's revived my interest in all things D!</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/33050570">How to recruit and retain top talent</a></p>
<p>It's not easy trying to grow a Drupal company in this day and age. Or indeed employ a Drupal person. Or get a Drupal site to work, etc. This video is just a gentle reminder we're all people and thus we need to share the monkey nuts far and wide. And chocolate. And beer. And pizza...</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/32931222">This Code Stinks</a></p>
<p>Great video from long-time Drupaler which makes you think twice about the code you write. Some of the examples given I think were a little harsh, I guess more of an inside joke maybe as I know how much everyone there gives in terms of time and effort, and sometimes things just slip by. But I'm the same, I'm a stickler for documenting code!</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/32929759">State of Drupal 7 Media</a></p>
<p>Really glad I watched this one - great to see there's been sprints and everything as it's a gallant effort trying to get all the various media and file methods working together in one nice place in Drupal and looks like it's finally getting in shape - go try it out!</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/32913601">From a Consulant to a Shop</a></p>
<p>Love this one - just what I'm going through right now and nice to hear from those who've been there, done that and got the Drupal T-shirt.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/32875642">Keynote - The Drupal Community</a></p>
<p>Angie Byron has to be our fave Drupal peep in terms of sheer patience having to deal with the mountainloads of stuff she has had to deal with over the last few years co-maintaining Drupal and doing a whole host of other stuff. From her early beginnings at the Google Summer of Code, Angie explains her journey so far and how you too can get involved no matter what you do or do not know so far!</p>

    <p><b>Railway time</b> was the name given to the standardised time arrangement first applied by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a> in England in November 1840. This was the first recorded occasion when a number of different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_mean_time" title="Local mean time">local times</a> were synchronised and a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_time" title="Standard time">standard time</a> applied. Railway time was progressively taken up by all of the other railway companies in Great Britain over the following two to three years. The times schedules by which trains were organised and the times train stations clocks displayed was brought in line with the local time for London or "London Time". This was also the time set at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich" title="Greenwich">Greenwich</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich" title="Royal Observatory, Greenwich">Royal Observatory</a>, which was already widely known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time" title="Greenwich Mean Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a> (GMT).</p>
<p>The development of railway networks in North America in the 1850s,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_time#cite_note-0">[1]</a> India in around 1860,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_time#cite_note-1">[2]</a> and as well as other countries in Europe, also prompted the introduction of standard time systems influenced by the specific, geographical, industrial development and political governance appertaining.</p>
<p>The key purpose behind introducing railway time was twofold: to overcome the confusion caused by having non-uniform local times in each town and station stop along the expanding railway network and to reduce the incidence of accidents and near misses, which were becoming more frequent as the number of train journeys increased.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_time">So says Wikipedia.</a></p>
<p>When I first looked into this subject of timezones I didn't realise how many people didn't know how timezones came to be, or that they came to be from a private company - GWR - and relatively not that long ago.</p>
<p>Times are different and we are now working in the world of the intangible when it comes to software, but I think the same rules apply - human kind has a great potential to benefit from these compromises such as time zones in terms of how we can leverage the stable platform it provides. With standardisation comes an element of non-excitement, however the value proposition of what you can build on top of that platform once in place is surely more alluring than forever bubbling away down below continuously reinventing the wheel?</p>
<p>Every day I see people doing the equivalent of creating a custom car for everyone who wants to drive from A to B when what most people want is a Ford Escort because they just want to sell X to Y in order to get Z out of it. In Drupal we have that, however we don't express that well enough to those who matter IMHO, and that's those on the ground who have to provide this online experience to those who have little knowledge, experience, and indeed cash in order to get themselves more connected. We with the knowledge have a duty IMHO to help those who don't, make most use of the technology available, and it shouldn't always be about this I know more than you who can piss up the tree high enough argument.</p>
<p>As I've often said, in the last ten years no-one's asked me to build rocket science for them. I don't use Drupal because it's an elegant solution to a problem, I use Drupal because it's there, already done for me, tested, working, etc. - well, to the 90-odd percent anyway - and means I can get on with something more interesting instead, like wondering whether to press "submit" on this blog article or not. Anyways, long-time readers will already know the answer to that one. Laters.</p>

    <p>I thought this evident but apparently not. You can download Drupal and run the tests provided. Just like that. If you download a few contribs and they have tests you still can run tests on any webserver, any environment what so ever to see whether they work together. It can be a small host or a cloud provider where all you have is the browser and no command line.</p>  </div>

<p>Have you ever needed to put Service links or ShareThis into block? How about AddToAny in a node link? Want to have different share buttons per content type? Want a simple way to add the latest widgets from Twitter, Facebook or Google to your site. Want to enable admins to customize widgets without having to dig into the API docs? It's time to start wrangling in all those <a href="http://www.leveltendesign.com/blog/tom/what-are-social-media-widgets-oooh-give-me">widgets</a>.</p>
<p>Virtually all the sites we have built over the last several years involve integration with sharing sites and social media through various code widgets, gadgets and plug-ins. The typical process of adding widgets by mixing modules, widget API configuration and custom blocks is tedious at best. To help organize and streamline this process, we recently released the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/widgets">Widgets module</a>. </p>
Defining the problem
<p>Widgets are small snippets of code that enable people to do a variety of things such as share content, visit social media profiles, view updates and so forth. Some widgets are simply copy and paste. Others require dynamic data such as a page title or URL. Many widgets can be customized by changing various parameters in their code.</p>
<p>The main challenges with widgets are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we place them on the site?</li>
<li>How do we deal with dynamic data?</li>
<li>How do we manage custom settings?</li>
<li>How do we keep a diverse set of widgets organized?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several modules that solve these problems for specific types of widgets in their own way. For example, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/service_links" target="_blank">Service links</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/addthis" target="_blank">AddThis</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/sharethis" target="_blank">ShareThis</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/addtoany" target="_blank">AddToAny</a> all enable you to add content sharing buttons to your site. There are others that help pull in Twitter and Facebook widgets. There are those that provide links to social media profiles – and the list goes on.</p>
<p>The main issue is that each has their own UI and feature set. Some allow you to place widgets into blocks, some in node links, some embedded into content, but there is no consistent standard. Some allow you to build one set of widgets, some multiple. Each deal with dynamic content in their own way, often through a specialized, single-use token system. Each has different support for caching.</p>
<p>That is not to say that these modules are bad, many are pretty great with their own slick interfaces. However, on today's highly socially-integrated sites, an array of widget types is needed. We need a standardized system for dealing with all these widgets.</p>
The Widgets module

<img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/widgets_definition_list.png" alt="Widgets definition list screenshot" />The Widgets module is meant to act as an API to help centralize management of various code snippets. It has an API for modules to provide code snippets via widget definitions. You can also add custom definitions via the admin.


<img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/widget_set_form.png" alt="Widgets set form screenshot" />Widgets definitions can be organized and customized into widget sets. Widget sets are built using an interface similar to core's image style admin. Just create a new widget set then add widget elements from a drop down list. You can sort widgets via drag and drop and modify customizable widgets via configuration forms.


<img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/visbility_settings.png" alt="Widgets visibility settings" />Sets can be displayed in blocks, tokens and node links by content type and display modes.


<img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/widget_definition_preview_form.png" alt="Widgets definition preview screenshot" />Drupal's core token system is used as the standard for managing dynamic data. Widget definitions can include standard tokens and special variable tokens which enable admins can configure settings per widget. A simple syntax makes it easy for widget definitions to auto-generate configuration forms from variable tokens.


<img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/widgets_set_list.png" alt="Widgets set list screenshot" />To make things even more plug and play, the API enables modules to define pre-built widget sets. These can be overridden and customized.


<img src="http://www.leveltendesign.com/files/cache_settings.png" alt="Widgets cache settings screenshot" />Finally, a tunable caching layer is used to assure widget sets load quickly. Caching can be set across all pages, by node authors, by page and by logged in user.


<p>We hope you find the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/widgets">Widgets module</a> as useful as we have for wrangling in the widget herds. Got any improvements, suggestions or comments? Let me know below.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>I have been meaning to make this post for quite some time. I have posted pieces before and had many discussions, but I have yet to write it out formally. Moshe's recent post about <a href="https://www.acquia.com/upal">Upal</a> motivated me to finally write the post.</p>
Background
<p>The SimpleTest code for mimicking browser behavior, specifically the form handling, has required a fair amount of upkeep, improvement, and generally wasted resources that could be better applied elsewhere. I attempted to clean things up with the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/browser">external browser component</a>, but that effort ended up dying. Overtime I became more and more convinced that we should revisit the basis for our testing system and try to rebuild things on an existing framework.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why we ever decided to create our own framework in the first place, which is indeed a good question. Back before we had a testing framework in core the concern with adding the <a href="http://simpletest.org/">SimpleTest.org</a> library to core was its size. At the time SimpleTest was not ready to depend on PHP 5 and specifically SimpleXML. It soon became clear that we could develop our own internal browser using a combination of PHP 5 tools that ended up being MUCH smaller then SimpleTest.org's implementation. This process was led by the poor assumption that we should commit the testing framework to Drupal core. In hindsight that was probably not the best idea.</p>
<p>Rather then commit a third-party library to core it should simply be included using a build script (like many other projects) and Drupal has a system tailored to do exactly that, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush_make">Drush make</a>. We could even use this approach for jQuery instead of committing the entire library into the core repository. Drupal.org already supports invoking Drush make scripts during release building so the general public wouldn't even notice the difference.</p>
<p>In addition to the size problem is the <a href="/the-woes-of-the-testbot">issue of bandwidth</a>, which myself and many others have discussed many times before. Keeping the Drupal testing integration (with testing library) in contrib would allow it to be maintained and more easily developed while removing an unnecessary burden from Drupal core.</p>
Combination of tools
<p>It is great to see Moshe's post and plan for building atop PHPUnit. Using PHPUnit definitely seems like a great start as it provides integration with many other tools, a familiar API, and using drush removes the "two Drupal sites" problem, but PHPUnit doesn't replace the browser component nor provide a JavaScript testing platform. At this point it seems prudent to build the functional tests atop Selenium which allows the tests to be written in PHP while elevating the need for the custom browser component and allowing for JavaScript testing.</p>
<p>I was part of the initial effort to get <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit">QUnit</a> into core along with <a href="http://drupal.org/user/157412">cwgordon7</a>. We had a working version integrated with the test runner, but things were derailed for various reasons which has since spawned the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/qunit">QUnit project</a> on Drupal.org.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/node/237566#comment-5252636">Webchick summed it up</a>:</p>
<p>
Yeah, ideally we use PHPUnit and QUnit for PHP/JS unit testing, respectively, and Selenium for functional testing. Those are each the best tools for the job.
</p>
<p>Selenium has also received some love in the form of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/selenium">SimpleTest integration</a> project on Drupal.org. We have the makings of a great testing setup, but we need to put the pieces together.</p>
Battle plan
<p>Moving forward it seems prudent to continue maintaining each of the pieces in their respective locations and outside of core.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selenium project needs to refactor to build on Upal</li>
<li>Rebuild DrupalWebTestCase as a compatibility layer on top of Selenium</li>
<li>Integrate QUnit project with Upal in a similiar fashion to Selenium</li>
<li>Provide PHPUnit test output parser for testbot</li>
<li>Provide a drush make script for testing in core or in a central hub repository in contrib</li>
<li>Inventory and refactor Drupal 8 tests to use new system while removing duplicity and waste</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets make this happen!</p>  </div>

    <p>Hi,<br />
This is not an update about new videos on my site, but is about future videos or audio that I think you might enjoy. Read more to see how you can get involved.</p>
Short version:
<p>I'm going to interview people in the Drupal community. Who would you like to hear from?</p>
Long version:

<p>I'm going to start recording conversations with people in the Drupal community. Lullabot is already producing <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/drupal-voices-lullabot/id311476095">Drupal Voices</a>, a podcast where Kent Bye interviews members of the Drupal community, and I love listening to his conversations! I also know that Kent is busy and that he can only interview so many people by himself. This means that there are a lot of people that are doing fantastic work, but aren't getting the exposure they deserve for the work that they do.</p>
<p>So, I thought I'd join in the fun and talk with some members of the community myself. And I'd really like to focus on people who are less well known, because there are so many people doing great things, and it's really fun to talk with people who are just starting something new and are totally passionate about what it is they are doing.</p>
Here's where you come in:
<p>Because I don't know everyone who is using Drupal, I would like to get your suggestions about who I should talk to (even if it's you!). Also, let me know what you would like me to ask them!<br />
You can reply to this email with your suggestions, or send them via my <a href="http://modulesunraveled.com/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

    <p>It's no secret that I travel around the world, evangelizing Drupal to new audiences and connecting with local communities, as well as contributors, from all over the world. In 2011 alone, I traveled more than 400,000 km (250,000 miles) and talked to thousands of Drupal people.  Every day, I answer questions that many in the larger community would benefit from knowing as well.</p>
<p>To help facilitate holding these discussions on more of an international scale, I’d like to experiment with doing monthly, informal chats.  In terms of format, I’d like to choose a general topic of discussion, then hold an hour-long phone call that all could dial into (with IRC for back-channel discussions and questions) where I can give an update on major Drupal happenings and allow plenty of time for Q&amp;A from the community on the topic for the month. A moderator will help with voicing/unvoicing people during the Q&amp;A section, and the chats would be recorded and put up for download for those who couldn’t make it.</p>
<p>If this idea sounds interesting to you, please <a href="https://acquiawebinars.webex.com/acquiawebinars/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp;d=669114608">join me for the first Drupal Fireside Chat on Friday, December 16 at 10 am Eastern US time</a> (registration recommended so click 'register').

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>Unit testing in Drupal using the standard <a href="http://drupal.org/project/simpletest">SimpleTest</a> approach has long been one of my pain points with Drupal apps. The main obstacle was setting up a realistic test "sandbox": The SimpleTest module builds a virtual site with a temporary database (within the existing database), from scratch, for every test suite. To accurately test the complex interactions of a real application, you need dozens of modules enabled in the sandbox, and installing all their database schemas takes a long time. If your site's components are exported to <a href="http://drupal.org/project/features">Features</a>, the tests gain another level of complexity. You could have the test turn on every module that's enabled on the real site, but then each suite takes 10 minutes to run. And that still isn't enough; you also need settings from the variables table, content types real nodes and users, etc.</p>

<p>So until recently, it came down to the choice: make simple but unrealistic sandboxes that tested minutia but not the big-picture interactions; or build massive sandboxes for each test that made the testing workflow impossible. After weeks of trying to get a SimpleTest environment working on a Drupal 6 application with a lot of custom code, and dozens of hours debugging the tests or the sandbox setups rather than building new functionality, I couldn't justify the time investment, and shelved the whole effort.</p>

<p>Then Moshe Weizman pointed me to his alternate <a href="https://github.com/weitzman/upal">upal</a> project, which aims to bring the <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/">PHPUnit</a> testing framework to Drupal, with backwards compatibility for SimpleTest assertions, but not the baggage of SimpleTest's Drupal implementation. Moshe <a href="https://acquia.com/upal">recently introduced upal</a> as a proposed testing framework for Drupal 8, especially for core. Separately, a few weeks ago, I started using upal for a different purpose: as a unit testing framework for custom applications in Drupal 6.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://github.com/newleafdigital/upal">forked the Github repo</a>, started a backport to D6 (copying from SimpleTest-6 where upal was identical to SimpleTest-7), and fixed some of the holes. More importantly, I'm taking a very different approach to the testing sandbox: I've set up an entirely separate test site, copied wholesale from the dev site (which itself is copied from the production site). This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can visually check the test sandbox at any time, because it runs as a virtualhost just like the dev site.</li>
<li>All the modules, settings, users, and content are in place for each test, and don't need to be created or torn down.</li>
<li>Rebuilding the sandbox is a single operation (with shell scripts to sync MySql, MongoDB, and files, manually triggered in Jenkins)</li>
<li>Cleanup of test-created objects occurs (if desired) on a piecemeal basis in tearDown() - drupalCreateNode() (modified) and drupalVariableSet() (added) optionally undo their changes when the test ends.</li>
<li>setUp() is not needed for most tests at all.</li>
<li>dumpContentsToFile() (added) replicates SimpleTest's ability to save curl'd files, but on a piecemeal basis in the test code.</li>
<li>Tests run <em>fast</em>, and accurately reflect the entirety of the site with all its actual interactions.</li>
<li>Tests are run by the <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> continuous-integration tool and the results are visible in Jenkins using the JUnit xml format.</li>
</ul>

How to set it up (with Jenkins, aka Hudson)

<p><em>(Note: the following are not comprehensive instructions, and assume familiarity with shell scripting and an existing installation of Jenkins.)</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Install upal from <a href="https://github.com/weitzman/upal">Moshe's repo</a> (D7) or <a href="https://github.com/newleafdigital/upal">mine</a> (D6). (Some of the details below I added recently, and apply only to the D6 fork.)</li>
<li>Install PHPUnit. The pear approach is easiest.</li>
<li>Upgrade drush: the notes say, "You currently need 'master' branch of drush after 2011.07.21. Drush 4.6 will be OK - http://drupal.org/node/1105514" - this seems to correspond to the HEAD of the 7.x-4.x branch in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush/git-instructions">Drush repository</a>.</li>
<li>Set up a webroot, database, virtualhost, DNS, etc for your test sandbox, and any scripts you need to build/sync it.</li>
<li>Configure phpunit.xml. Start with upal's readme, then (D6/fork only) add DUMP_DIR (if wanted), and if HTTP authentication to the test site is needed, UPAL_HTTP_USER and UPAL_HTTP_PASS. In my version I've split the DrupalTestCase class to its own file, and renamed drupal_test_case.php to upal.php, so rename the "bootstrap" parameter accordingly.
** (note: the upal notes say it must run at a URL ending in /upal - this is no longer necessary with this approach.)</li>
<li>PHPUnit expects the files to be named .php rather than .test - however if you explicitly call an individual .test file (rather than traversing a directory, the approach I took), it might work. You can also remove the getInfo() functions from your SimpleTests, as they don't do anything anymore.</li>
<li>If Jenkins is on a different server than the test site (as in my case), make sure Jenkins can SSH over.</li>
<li>To use dumpContentsToFile() or the XML results, you'll want a dump directory (set in phpunit.xml), and your test script should wipe the directory before each run, and rsync the files to the build workspace afterwards.</li>
<li>To convert PHPUnit's JUnit output to the format Jenkins understands, you'll need the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/xUnit+Plugin">xUnit</a> plugin for Jenkins. Then point the Jenkins job to read the XML file (after rsync'ing if running remotely). [Note: the last 3 steps have to be done with SimpleTest and Jenkins too.]</li>
<li>Code any wrapper scripts around the above steps as needed.</li>
<li>Write some tests! (Consult the <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/manual/current/en/index.html">PHPUnit documentation</a>.)</li>
<li>Run the tests!</li>
</ol>

Some issues I ran into (which you might also run into)

<ol>
<li>PHPUnit, unlike SimpleTest, stops a test function after the first failure. This isn't a bug, it's <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5651663/phpunit-multiple-assertions-in-a-single-test-only-first-failure-seen">expected behavior</a>, even with --stop-on-failure disabled. I'd prefer it the other way, but that's how it is.</li>
<li>Make sure your test site - like any dev site - does not send any outbound mail to customers, run unnecessary feed imports, or otherwise perform operations not meant for a non-production site.</li>
<li>In my case, Jenkins takes 15 minutes to restart (after installing xUnit for example). I don't know why, but keep an eye on the Jenkins log if it's taking you a while too.</li>
<li>Also in my case, Jenkins runs behind an Apache reverse-proxy; in that case when Jenkins restarts, it's usually necessary to restart Apache, or else it gets stuck thinking the proxy endpoint is down.</li>
<li>I ran into a bug with Jenkins stopping its shell script commands arbitrarily before the end. I worked around it by moving the whole job to a shell script on the Jenkins server (which in turn delegates to a script on the test/dev server).</li>
</ol>

<p>There is a pending <a href="https://github.com/weitzman/upal/pull/2">pull request</a> to pull some of the fixes and changes I made back into the original repo. In the pull request I've tried to separate what are merely fixes from what goes with the different test-site approach I've taken, but it's still a tricky merge. Feel free to help there, or make your own fork with a separate test site for D7.</p>

<p>I now have a working test environment with PHPUnit and upal, with all of the tests I wrote months ago working again (minus their enormous setUp() functions), and I've started writing tests for new code going forward. Success!</p>

    <p>Acquia Dev Cloud is the Drupal cloud hosting platform for <em>developers</em>, and today I'm really psyched to announce availability of a frequently requested developer feature: Acquia Cloud Hooks.</p>
<p>If you'd rather try Cloud Hooks instead of reading about them, you can <a href="/cloud-pricing#hardware=51&amp;storage=91&amp;subscription=1687922" target="new">sign up right now</a> and use coupon code BJB111209 to get the first 30 days free.</p>


What are Cloud Hooks?

<p>In my previous post about the <a href="/blog/acquia-cloud-ux-improvements-free-30-day-trials">Acquia Cloud Workflow UI</a>, I explained how Acquia Cloud automates the most common tasks involved in managing a Drupal site: deploying code from a version control system, and migrating code, databases, and files across your Development, Staging, and Production environments.</p>

<p>Cloud Hooks go much farther by allowing you to automate almost anything else as part of your Workflow actions. A Cloud Hook is a script in your code repository that Acquia Cloud executes on your behalf when a triggering action occurs. Examples of tasks that you can automate with Cloud Hooks include:</p>

<ul><li>Perform Drupal database updates, run a test suite, or run a performance/load test each time new code is deployed.</li>
<li>"Scrub" your Production database when it is copied to Dev or Staging by removing customer emails or disabling production-only modules.</li>
<li>Supposing your site copies its user-uploaded files in S3, you can synchronize your S3 buckets each time you copy files between your Dev, Staging, or Production environments.</li>
</ul>A quick example

<p>Cloud Hook scripts are simple and can be written in shell, PHP, Perl, Ruby, or even C if you want to compile it yourself. Here's an example  that runs "drush updatedb" (the equivalent of running database updates via update.php):</p>

#!/bin/sh<br />#<br /># Cloud Hook: update-db<br />#<br /># Run drush updatedb in the target environment. This script works as<br /># any Cloud hook.<br /><br />site="$1"<br />target_env="$2"<br /><br />drush @$site.$target_env updatedb --yes

<p>Drop this script into /hooks/common/post-code-deploy/update-db.sh and it will run every time you deploy a new code branch or tag from Git or SVN to any of your environments. If you only want it to run when you deploy new code to your Production environment, put it in /hooks/prod/post-code-deploy/update-db.sh instead.</p>

Get started and contribute

<p>Getting started instructions, complete documentation, hook templates, and sample scripts are available at <a href="https://github.com/acquia/cloud-hooks">https://github.com/acquia/cloud-hooks</a>.</p>

<p>We know that our users will think of more creative uses for Cloud Hooks than we will (in fact, the idea for the S3-syncing script came from our friends at <a href="http://musescore.com/">musescore.com</a>). We encourage you develop and share your own Cloud Hook scripts. You can fork the GitHub repo and submit pull requests for scripts that you want to contribute. We can wait to see what you come up with!</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org">Varnish</a> is a reverse-proxy cache that allows a site with a heavy backend (such as a Drupal site) and mostly consistent content to handle very high traffic load. The &#8220;cache&#8221; part refers to Varnish storing the entire output of a page in its memory, and the &#8220;reverse proxy&#8221; part means it functions as its own server, sitting in front of Apache and passing requests back to Apache only when necessary.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with implementing Varnish, however, is the complex &#8220;VCL&#8221; protocol it uses to process requests with custom logic. The <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/reference/vcl.html#syntax">syntax</a> is unusual, the <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs">documentation</a> relies heavily on complex examples, and there don&#8217;t seem to be any books or other comprehensive resources on the software. A recent link on the project site to <a href="http://kristianlyng.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/varnish-training/">Varnish Training</a> is just a pitch for a paid course. Searching more specifically for Drupal + Varnish will bring up many good results - including <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/articles/varnish-multiple-web-servers-drupal">Lullabot&#8217;s fantastic tutorial</a> from April, and older examples for Mercury - but the latest stable release is now 3.x and many of the examples (written for 2.x) <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/3.0/installation/upgrade.html">don&#8217;t work</a> as written anymore. So it takes a lot of trial and error to get it all working.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running Varnish on <a href="http://antiquesnearme.com">AntiquesNearMe.com</a>, partly to keep our hosting costs down by getting more power out of less [virtual] hardware. A side benefit is the site&#8217;s ability to respond very nicely if the backend Apache server ever goes down. They&#8217;re on separate VPS's (connected via internal private networking), and if the Apache server completely explodes from memory overload, or I simply need to upgrade a server-related package, Varnish will display a themed &#8220;We&#8217;re down for a little while&#8221; message.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t until recently that I got Varnish&#8217;s primary function, caching, really tuned. I spent several days under the hood recently, and while I don&#8217;t want to rehash what&#8217;s already been well covered in <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/articles/varnish-multiple-web-servers-drupal">Lullabot&#8217;s tutorial</a>, here are some other things I learned:</p>
Check syntax before restarting
<p>After you update your VCL, you need to restart Varnish - using sudo /etc/init.d/varnish restart for instance - for the changes to take effect. If you have a syntax error, however, this will take down your site. So check the syntax first (change the path to your VCL as needed):<br />
varnishd -C -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl &gt; /dev/null</p>
<p>If there are errors, it will display them; if not, it shows nothing. Use that as a visual check before restarting. (Unfortunately the exit code of that command is always 0, so you can&#8217;t do check-then-restart as simply as check-varnish-syntax &amp;&amp; /etc/init.d/varnish restart, but you could grep the output for the words &#8220;exit 1&#8221; to accomplish the same.)</p>
Logging
<p>The std.log function allows you to generate arbitrary messages about Varnish&#8217;s processing. Add import std; at the top of your VCL file, and then std.log(&quot;DEV: some useful message&quot;) anywhere you want. The &#8220;DEV&#8221; prefix is an arbitrary way of differentiating your logs from all the others. So you can then run in the shell, varnishlog | grep &quot;DEV&quot; and watch only the information you&#8217;ve chosen to see.</p>
<p>How I use this:<br />
- At the top of vcl_recv() I put std.log(&quot;DEV: Request to URL: &quot; + req.url);, to put all the other logs in context.<br />
- When I pipe back to apache, I put std.log(&quot;DEV: piping &quot; + req.url + &quot; straight back to apache&quot;); before the return (pipe);<br />
- On blocked URLs (cron, install), the same<br />
- On static files (images, JS, CSS), I put std.log(&quot;DEV: Always caching &quot; + req.url);<br />
- To understand all the regex madness going on with cookies, I log req.http.Cookie at every step to see what&#8217;s changed.</p>
<p>Plug some of these in, check the syntax, restart Varnish, run varnishlog|grep PREFIX as above, and watch as you hit a bunch of URLs in your browser. Varnish&#8217;s internal logic will quickly start making more sense.</p>
Watch Varnish work with your browser
<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3862873/varnish-headers-inspector.png" alt="Varnish headers in Chrome Inspector"><br />
The Chrome/Safari Inspector and Firebug show the headers for every request made on a page. With Varnish running, look at the Response Headers for one of them: you&#8217;ll see &#8220;Via: Varnish&#8221; if the page was processed through Varnish, or &#8220;Server:Apache&#8221; if it went through Apache. (Using Chrome, for instance, login to your Drupal site and the page should load via Apache (assuming you see page elements not available to anonymous users), then open an Incognito window and it should run through Varnish.)</p>
Add hit/miss headers
<ul>
<li>When a page is supposed to be cached (not pipe'd immediately), Varnish checks if there is an existing hit or miss. To watch this in your Inspector, use this logic:</li>
</ul>

sub vcl_deliver {
  std.log(&quot;DEV: Hits on &quot; + req.url + &quot;: &quot; + obj.hits);
&nbsp;
  if (obj.hits &gt; 0) {
    set resp.http.X-Varnish-Cache = &quot;HIT&quot;;
  }
  else {
    set resp.http.X-Varnish-Cache = &quot;MISS&quot;;
  }
&nbsp;
  return (deliver);
}
<p>Then you can clear the caches, hit a page (using the browser technique above), see &#8220;via Varnish&#8221; and a MISS, hit it again, see a HIT (or not), and know if everything is working.</p>
Clear Varnish when aggregated CSS+JS are rebuilt
<p>If you have CSS/JS aggregation enabled (as recommended), your HTML source will reference long hash-string files. Varnish caches that HTML with the hash string. If you clear only those caches (&#8220;requisites&#8221; via Admin Menu or cc css+js via Drush), Varnish will still have the <em>old</em> references, but the files will have been deleted. Not good. You could simply never use that operation again, but that&#8217;s a little silly.</p>
<p>The heavy-handed solution I came up with (I welcome alternatives) is to wipe the Varnish cache when CSS+JS resets. That operation is not hook-able, however, so you have to patch core. In common.js, _drupal_flush_css_js(), add:</p>
<p>

if (module_exists('varnish') &amp;&amp; function_exists('varnish_purge_all_pages')) {
  varnish_purge_all_pages();
}
</p>
<p>This still keeps Memcache and other in-Drupal caches intact, avoiding an unnecessary &#8220;clear all caches&#8221; operation, but makes sure Varnish doesn&#8217;t point to dead files. (You could take it a step further and purge only URLs that are Drupal-generated and not static; if you figure out the regex for that, please share.)</p>
Per-page cookie logic
<p>On <a href="http://antiquesnearme.com">AntiquesNearMe.com</a> we have a cookie that remembers the last location you searched, which makes for a nicer UX. That cookie gets added to Varnish&#8217;s page &#8220;hash&#8221; and (correctly) bypasses the cache on pages that take that cookie into account. The cookie is not relevant to the rest of the site, however, so it should be ignored in those cases. How to handle this?</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/VCLExampleRemovingSomeCookies">two ways</a> to handle cookies in Varnish: strip cookies you know you don&#8217;t want, as in this old <a href="https://wiki.fourkitchens.com/display/PF/Configure+Varnish+for+Pressflow">Pressflow example</a>, or leave only the cookies you know you <em>do</em> want, as in Lullabot&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lullabot.com/articles/varnish-multiple-web-servers-drupal">example</a>. Each strategy has its pros and cons and works on its own, but it&#8217;s not advisable to <em>combine</em> them. I&#8217;m using Lullabot&#8217;s technique on this site, so to deal with the location cookie, I use if-else logic: if the cookie is available but <em>not</em> needed (determined by regex like req.url !~ &quot;PATTERN&quot; || ...), then strip it; otherwise keep it. If the cookie logic you need is more varied but still linear, you could create a series of elsif statements to handle all the use cases. (Just make sure to roast a huge pot of coffee first.)</p>
Useful add-ons to varnish.module
<ul>
<li>Added watchdog('varnish', ...) commands in varnish.module on cache-clearing operations, so I could look at the logs and spot problems.</li>
<li>Added a block to varnish.module with a &#8220;Purge this page&#8221; button for each URL, shown only for admins. (I saw this in an Akamai module and it made a lot of sense to copy. I&#8217;d be happy to post a patch if others want this.)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/expire">Expire</a> offers plug-n-play intelligence to selectively clear Varnish URLs only when necessary (clearing a landing page of blog posts only if a blog post is modified, for example.) Much better than the default behavior of aggressive clearing &#8220;just in case&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps people adopt Varnish. I am also available via my consulting business <a href="http://newleafdigital.com">New Leaf Digital</a> for paid implementation, strategic advice, or support for Varnish-aided sites.</p>  </div>

    I presented at DrupalCon London on <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/conference/sessions/how-have-open-relationship-software-and-still-make-paper">
    contributing to Drupal</a>.  The talk is called <em>“How to have an open
    relationship… with software.”</em>  Sadly, there is no nudity,
    polygamy or even dirty jokes. 
</p>

<p><a href="https://img.skitch.com/20111212-j9bf7rjhkagfampfafgc8y8r7k.png"><img src="https://img.skitch.com/20111212-j9bf7rjhkagfampfafgc8y8r7k.png" height="400px" /></a></p>
<p>
     Nope, it’s just about how it is strategic
    to contribute to Open Source software and techniques for sales, marketing, management
    and developers. I did the same <a href="http://www.drupalcampmontreal.com/sessions/how-have-open-relationship-software-and-still-get-paid-free-software-material-world">
    talk at Drupal Camp Montreal</a> in September (<a href="http://bcooltv.mcgill.ca/Viewer2/?RecordingID=71865">video</a> and <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/jacobsingh/p/how-to-have-an-open-relationship-with-software"> Slides - not matching video</a>).
</p>
  
  
     
  
  
     
  

  
    It’s a lot of fun to do this talk.  It’s also the first time
    I’ve presented on non-technical topics.  There is a lot more doubt there.
     When presenting on a technical topic I know that I am an authoritative voice on
    the topic.  That is, I have facts at my disposal. Solid, indisputable knowledge
    that my audience (at least 99% of them), will not have.  That is a position of
    power, it’s why
  

  <ul><li>Engineers have good stability and income</li>

    <li>Managers are scared to death we aren’t really working hard</li>

    <li>We had a boss screen in DOOM and it worked, etc.</li>
  </ul>
    My new talk is all opinions.  If I’m generous, I can say I have experience
    and knowledge, which makes my opinions authoritative, but that’s like saying
    because I’ve ridden on a lot of airplanes, I’m a pilot.  It’s
    soft material, I’m just saying things I’ve observed and what I think
    works.  That’s terrifying!
  

  
    
      Because I was so nervous about this, I did what I do most of the time when
      I’m nervous, I went and asked people smarter than myself.  I sent out 2
      e-mails. 
    
  

  
    One to people I knew who worked in business development and/or manage engineers and
    one to developers (both freelancers and salaried).  In the e-mails, I asked them
    a series of questions about how contributing to Drupal has changed the way they work
    and the satisfaction they get out of their efforts.  I turned these into several
    slides in my presentation, but there was a lot of great content there which
    didn’t fit on a slide.  Here are a few I found well written and
    interesting:
  

  
     
  

  What was the biggest hurdle to contributing for you?  How did you get over
  it?

  
    When I started, I thought that many of the patches weren't important enough to
    contribute, and the idea create a complete new project/module under my name was too
    scary. I learned two things: every idea is worth contributing, no matter how small.
    It might be a quick tip on a forum post, an extra link or a screenshot in
    documentation or a small fix such as a missing t() function or adding a
    hook_uninstall to a module. And you don't have to wait until you have a full-blown
    and zero-bug module before you do your first commit. I've learned to commit often and
    fail early. Committing dev versions or even using the sandbox already attracts some
    attention to people who are looking to solve the same problem, and it makes for early
    and good collaboration.

  How does being a contributing member of the community change the way you work?

  
    Inherently, it doesn't: I *always* open source work when that makes sense, whether
    it's Drupal or C++ code.
  

  
     
  

  
    However, in the context of Drupal, there is one special thing you should do as a
    contributor: if there already is some module that partially solves the problem, but
    has been forgotten/neglected, then revive this code by extending/updating it to make
    it usable in your project and publish this code on Drupal.org (<a href="http://Drupal.org">http://Drupal.org</a>).
    Even if you don't want to keep maintaining it, you're at least contributing
    *something* back this way.

  What patterns do you use to modify functionality without hacking contrib or writing
  your own custom modules? 

  
    This is the most powerful hook in Drupal
  

  
    <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes--theme.inc/function/template_preprocess/6">http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes--theme.inc/function/template_p...</a>
  

  
    Use it rarely if ever.

  How do you structure contribution time for your developers outside of client
  projects?

  
     
  

   <ol><li>Pay everyone hourly</li>
 	 <li>Everyone earns 20% time toward community work that they take when it makes sense</li>
   </ol>
    Point 1 is key, because salaried companies often sacrifice community time for project deadlines. Then people lose track of their 20% (or whatever it is) and never get to it.
  

  
     
  

  
    For point 2, we ask the team to use their best judgment in how to spend the time that will benefit Drupal and the company.
  

  
     
  

  
    That's it :)

  How do you explain the benefits of contributing to OSS to your customers and
  potential customers?

  
     
  

  
    Mainly, our customers don't recognise the concept of contributing to open source one
    way or another. Again, they're non-technical. They just want it to work. But we do
    explain that by using Drupal as our underlying CMS we are plugging into the
    collective experience of an entire community of thousands of developers -- something
    far beyond what we could do by ourselves. This reassures them that the solution we
    provide will be sustainable and extensible over time, and won't dry up even if we
    do.

  Do you engage in "coopetition" with other companies?  How has that been
  successful?  How has it failed?

  
     
  

  
    Quite a bit actually.  There are some shops that we team up with on some
    projects because they can provide a skill set that we don't have in house and vice
    versa.  Then on a different project altogether we may both be bidding on it.
     And on a third, we may be doing only one part of the project even though we can
    provide the full set of services.  Sometimes the collaboration is rewarding in
    and of it self, along with the opportunity to work with a specific client.

  How does an applicant's contribution record affect your hiring decisions?

  
     
  

  
    An applicant’s contribution record on d.o (or elsewhere) does have an impact,
    but not as much as some might guess.  For Palantir, it’s more about fit
    than it is about your d.o # or how many commits you’ve got.  We have a
    close knit team, with a very interesting sense of humor as well as strong
    care/commitment to each other.  If someone were to come along with all the d.o
    creds, but they couldn’t collaborate well with our team, then they
    wouldn’t be happy nor would the team.  
  

  
     
  

  
    We also seek out the opportunity to mentor new people into the Drupal community -
    introduce them to all the things we already love, and hate ;), about Drupal.  In
    this case it wouldn’t matter if they knew what Drupal even was.  If they
    had all the same qualities that we see in our team and in the greater community:
    passion, self motivation, community, collaboration, sense of humor etc. then they
    could be a better fit again that someone who’s incredibly well know in Drupal

 The future 
  
I originally wrote this a couple months ago and have since given the same talk at <a href="http://drupalcampmumbai.org/">DrupalCamp Mumbai</a> and <a href="http://drupalcampdeccan.in/">DrupalCamp Hyderabad</a>.  It was a great experience at both and it is has evolved.  Unfortunately, it did not get accepted to DrupalCon Denver, but a <a href="denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/elephants-are-coming-drupal-india-china-and-beyond">new talk on Drupal in emerging markets</a> did!  Hope to see you there!

 <p>I am thinking of doing this talk some more and perhaps turning it into a video or a website.  Would anyone be interested in such a thing?</p>

<p>How has contributing to Drupal (or another open source project), been a strategic venture for your company?</p>

<p>Healthcare, love it or hate it, it's not going away and in fact the healthcare industry is booming and continues to grow.  Almost daily we hear about some revolutionary break through in medicine that will help us to lead longer healthier lives.  The web has made sharing knowledge and information easier and easier and the emergence of smart phones allows anyone to access years of historical data at their fingertips.  The problem is that traditionally this data has been uploaded through systems that are archaic and quickly becoming obsolete thanks to the rapid emergence of open source tools like Drupal.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, we've seen Drupal's adoption in the arts and entertainment industry, government organizations, online publishing, social communities and now healthcare.  At LevelTen we have had the opportunity to implement Drupal for numerous healthcare industry clients like: <a href="http://carislifesciences.com">Caris Life Sciences</a>, <a href="http://healthmarketscience.com">Health Market Science</a>, <a href="http://missionpharmacal.com">Mission Pharmacal</a> and <a href="http://www.mckesson.com">McKesson</a> to name a few.  Just like those in other industries, the medical world is starting to realize the speed at which they can deploy new products and brand focused sites utilizing Drupal's intelligent framework.</p>
<p>The healthcare industry is extremely specialized and often times the information can be confusing or overwhelming to the end users.  Utilizing Drupal, a website can be easily modified or changed based upon feedback from patients and site visitors, and ultimately continue to make the site better and more user-friendly over time as a result of that feedback.  Plus, some of the more advanced features allow for easily sharing related information and content; in the long run those extra tools will equate to a greater visitor return rate and longer website visit times.</p>
<p>Maybe you're considering Drupal for your medical organization; here are just a couple of great points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration - Drupal has a very sophisticated structure and as such can be tied into almost any applications, applications with a solid API are even easier.  The benefit of integration is a universal experience for all of your site users and visitors.</li>
<li>Customization - Drupal has over 8000 modules (extensions to add functionality) currently available and that list only continues to grow.  The benefit speaks for it's self, but the more options available to choose from the faster your site can be deployed, ultimately lowering costs.</li>
<li>Easy to Update - Drupal is a CMS and a framework both; the CMS portion when combined with the right modules, makes it easy for non-technical staff to update and manage the website. </li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on and on, but if you're in the healthcare industry and reading this then Drupal is probably already on your radar; either way I would love to speak with you about some of our past projects and approach to see how we might be able to help you.</p>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>We&#8217;re steadily getting closer to a vision of the semantic web &#8211; and it&#8217;s being driven by Facebook through their Open Graph Protocol. <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> came out in 2010, and it initially supported a large set of different object types and properties (for instance, music, article, book) &#8211; very interesting, but there are certainly more object types now!</p>
<p>In my case, I wanted to create an app for keeping track of highpoints, which are the highest point in each US state (for instance, Mount Whitney in California). Users can &#8220;summit&#8221; a highpoint, and then share that on their Facebook Timeline through an iPhone app I&#8217;m working on:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jefflinwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Highpointer-GuadPeak.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-434" title="Highpointer-GuadPeak" src="http://www.jefflinwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Highpointer-GuadPeak-154x300.png" alt="" width="154" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>To support the Open Graph Protocol, you&#8217;ll need Drupal to provide meta tags for Facebook to parse. There are several modules in this space, but the momentum appears to be with the D7 module <a href="http://drupal.org/project/metatag">Metatag</a>. Metatag is great, but it does not support custom Open Graph types (in the November dev release, anyway), so I had to modify the Open Graph module to add my &#8220;highpointer:highpoint&#8221; Open Graph type, and it&#8217;s custom properties &#8211; state and height. I also had to add &#8220;fb:app_id&#8221; as a custom type, because I didn&#8217;t want to use the Drupal for Facebook module just yet for this project. The next step would be to make this more flexible.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to create an app as a Facebook Developer, then configure its Open Graph type, action, and properties. Your iOS or Android app can make one call to the Facebook API to tell Facebook that your user has summited a highpoint, or read a book, or whatever your site does. Then, in their Facebook Timeline, your app&#8217;s Aggregation will show up:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jefflinwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/HighPointer-FBTimeline.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-435" title="HighPointer-FBTimeline" src="http://www.jefflinwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/HighPointer-FBTimeline.png" alt="" width="429" height="268" /></a></p>
<p>Right now, the Facebook iOS SDK Single Sign On does not work with the code samples they provide and the current version of the Facebook mobile app and iOS 5. The workaround is to either authenticate through Mobile Safari to the mobile version of Facebook&#8217;s web site, or put up a Facebook login dialog box in your app for the user to authorize your app. I went with the login dialog box:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jefflinwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/HighPointer-FBLogin.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-433" title="HighPointer-FBLogin" src="http://www.jefflinwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/HighPointer-FBLogin-154x300.png" alt="" width="154" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Toolbar icons and app background are from <a href="http://www.medialoot.com/">MediaLoot</a>, which is a great graphic design resource, and well worth the money.</p>

Everything was a bit more relaxed and informal, but that made it feel that much more cozy.</p>

                    <p><a href='http://openlayers.org/'>OpenLayers</a> is a powerful mapping framework that allows you to create beautiful maps in a short amount of time. Recently, we have been working on an OpenLayers map for a client that requested "density circles," or a way to visually show concentration of projects within a region. I remembered  <a href='http://2011.badcamp.net/attendees/zzolo'>Alan Palazzolo</a> mentioning a project called "OpenLayers Plus" during <a href='http://2011.badcamp.net/program/sessions/making-beautiful-maps-drupal'>his session at BadCamp</a> back in the fall.</p>

<p>When I looked into <a href='https://github.com/developmentseed/openlayers_plus'>Development Seed's OpenLayers Plus GitHub</a> project I noticed that it was designed for Drupal 6, and this site was Drupal 7. After some help from <a href='http://atendesigngroup.com/blog/author/scott'>Scott</a>, I was able to use density circles on our map. Turns out, we only needed to change a few things to get it working in Drupal 7. Here are some step-by-step instruction on how to get OpenLayers Plus working in Drupal 7 (assumes you have already built your OpenLayers data layer with a view):</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the <a href='https://github.com/developmentseed/openlayers_plus'>OpenLayers Plus module</a></li>
<li>Change the .info file to use Drupal 7 as the core (core = "7.x")</li>
<li>Enclosed all JavaScript functions with the ($) wrapper (we only made this update in openlayers_plus_behavior_scalepoints.js because that is the one behavior we wanted to use)</li>
<li>Make sure your OpenLayers map is pointed to the correct OpenLayers data view under "Layers &amp; Styles" in the OpenLayers module config.</li>
<li>Make sure to check the new options you want under the "Behaviors" tab in the OpenLayers module config. They should be prefaced by "OL +"</li>
</ol>

<p>Our view was using aggregation to count the number of projects per region. That value was served in the OpenLayers data view under a field called "nid." This is the value we entered for "Field" under the "OL + Scalepoints" options. You can find our <a href='http://drupal.org/sandbox/chandonthegreat/1368888'>source code in our sandbox project</a>.</p>

<p>The end product shows density circles for each region:</p>

Sometimes, though, you don't want to <em>hide</em> content entirely. If you're teasing visitors with a glimpse of premium content, you don't want nodes to be <em>completely</em> hidden. What you need is the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/premium_content">Premium Content</a> module.</p>
<p>Based on the venerable Premium module for Drupal 4.7 and 5.0, Premium Content leaves node teasers untouched, ensuring that content shows up as normal on listing pages. When a user who <em>doesn't</em> have permission to view premium content visits the node's full page, however, they get a message prompting them to register or upgrade their account.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lullabot.com/sites/lullabot.com/files/premium-in-action.png" class="fancy" alt="Screenshot of premium-access content" /></p>
<p>Premium Content ships with automatic support for two common "premium scenarios." Archival mode leaves all nodes publicly visible when they're created, but automatically marks them as premium once they're two weeks old. "Embargo" mode keeps content premium when it's posted, but releases it to the public after two weeks. Administrators can customize the time periods for those automatic changes, or switch to manual mode, allowing authors to designate individual nodes as premium when they're created.</p>  </div>
