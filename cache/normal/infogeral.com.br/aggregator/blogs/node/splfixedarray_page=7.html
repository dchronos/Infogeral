Last week we lunched redesign of it's web variant, which is a news portal with about 200.000 unique visitors and 4.5 million impressions per month. This numbers wil definetely become larger soon, as they have monthly growth between 10 and 15%.</p>
<p>Site was developed on <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal 7</a>. We extensively used <a href="http://drupal.org/project/panels">Panels</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a>. Search is based on <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a>, driven by <a href="http://drupal.org/project/search_api">Search API framework</a>. To achieve performance we used <a href="http://drupal.org/project/memcache">Memcached</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/varnish">Varnish</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/apc">APC</a> and developed some own cache expiration rules. This is how we achieved performance we needed and flexibility requested by editorial team. Everything is hosted on our own HA LAMP stack.</p>
<p>Just two days after launch we had national elections in Slovenia, which are also a big media event. Our site broke the record in daily visits and everything was working smooth.</p>
<p>Since a custom CMS, which was developed inside company about 10 years ago, was used before, one of the most important aspects of this project was experience for editorial team. They learned how to use Drupal surprisingly fast. There were some minor issues reported, but in general Drupal works really got for them.</p>
<p>Site was developed by core development team:</p>

<p>We will publish some more information about project in the following weeks.</p>

They're a bit dull, though, and can easily blend in with the rest of a site's content. In addition,while most Drupal features provide copious hooks for developers to tweak, there's no simple way to hide some messages and show others, alter the text of a given message, and so on.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/absolute_messages">Absolute Messages</a> fixes that, layering some snappy display options onto Drupal's normal message system <em>and</em> giving developers a set of convenient hooks to manipulate messages while before they're displayed.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lullabot.com/sites/lullabot.com/files/am-in-action.png" class="fancy" alt="Screenshot of Absolute Messages in action" /></p>
<p>The most visible change once you've installed Absolute Messages is the appearance of Drupal's system messages. They appear at the top of the screen, in color-coded boxes with their own 'Dismiss This Message' close boxes. The style is modeled after the popular <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> site, and it duplicates some of the site's behaviors as well. Long messages can be collapsed to just a few lines, expanding when the user mouses over them, and normal status messages can automatically close themselves after a few seconds.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, these rules can be configured for each type of message -- Status, Warning, and Error -- ensuring that <em>important</em> notices don't go away while a user isn't looking.</p>  </div>

      <a href="/aggregator/sources/1" class="feed-item-source">Ultimas noticias do drupal</a> -
      <span class="feed-item-date">Seg, 05/12/2011 - 08:04</span>
  </div>

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    
      
           <p>With Radioactivity 2 nearly out of its beta form, I thought I'd write a bit about what it is and what you can do with it and most importantly walk you through on how to use it.</p>
<p class="p2">Radioactivity 2 allows you to track any fieldable entities; users, nodes, commerce products, etc. It can be used as a simple view counter but also as a popularity or activity meter, e.g. with it you can create a 'most viewed nodes at this moment' list. There is also limited rules which allows you to create an activity meter for basically whatever you want. </p>
<p class="p2">For this tutorial we need to install and enable <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">views</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ctools">ctools</a> and the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/radioactivity">radioactivity</a> modules.</p>
<p class="p2">After that we need to create three things:</p>
<ol><li class="p1">Decay profile</li>
	<li class="p1">Radioactivity field</li>
	<li class="p1">View</li>
</ol><p class="p2">Before we dwell deeper lets go through some of the terminology and settings.</p>
Terminology
<ul><li class="p2"><b>Energy:</b> the hotness/popularity/views/etc. of the field.</li>
	<li class="p1"><b>Incident: </b>an event where a value is added to or subtracted from energy.</li>
	<li class="p1"><b>Decay profile: </b>defines whether or not the energy decays and has settings for it.</li>
	<li class="p1"><b>Granularity:</b> how often is the field energy updated - in essence this defines the resolution in which the ordering happens. You can easily visualize this with the graph.</li>
	<li class="p1"><b>Half life: </b>how long does it takes for energy to half. </li>
	<li class="p1"><b>Cut off: </b>at which point is the energy considered non-existent.</li>
	<li class="p1"><b>Incident storage: </b>where are the incidents stored and how they are processed.</li>
</ul>Settings
<p class="p2">There are two very important parts on the Radioactivity settings page:</p>
<p class="p2">Salt for checksums and the Configuration (assist). To prevent 3rd parties from manipulating the field energies with scripts/bots, you should choose a good random string (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">a salt</a>) used in calculating the checksums for the ajax callbacks. </p>
<p class="p2">The second important part is to set up the radioactivity configuration file: <i>radioactivity-boostrap.cfg.inc. </i>This file holds all the required settings for the callback script to work without drupal and this is important for high traffic sites; If the file is missing the callback script does a partial drupal bootstrap so that it can function properly. Note that <i>Live </i>and <i>Deferred storage</i> types require drupal to bootstrap while the experimental <i>File storage</i> does not (non-boostrap memcache support is under development).</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/settings.png"><img alt="" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/settings.png" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><b>All that boils down to this: </b>A user navigates to a node, node has a radioactivity field which - when visible - generates an incident with an ajax callback which increments the fields energy. The energy is manipulated with the settings defined in the decay profile (granularity, half-life) over time (cron runs) and it is considered to be zero when energy level is below the cut off level. </p>
<p class="p1">Lets get started.</p>
<p class="p1">We will create a setup which tracks article popularity in a 6 hour timeframe so that the articles without views for 6 hours will have half of the initial energy and that it takes 50 views for them to reach the same energy level as a brand new one with 1000 energy.</p>
<b>1. Decay Profile</b>
<p class="p2">Navigate to the <i>Radioactivity</i> decay profiles page under <i>Structure</i> (admin/structure/radioactivity). Notice that there are no decay profiles yet, so lets create a decay profile by clicking the <i>Add</i> link at the top.</p>
<p class="p2">You are presented with the following form:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/profile.png"><img alt="" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/profile.png" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">The form is filled with default values that should be suitable for most use cases with a good number of daily visitors. For this example we will use the defaults which is a 6 hour half life with 1 minute granularity. Note that finding the correct values for your site may take a few weeks and it usually requires some grooming.</p>
<p class="p2">At the moment there are three working storage types available:</p>
<ul><li class="p1"><b>Live storage -</b> this updates the energy directly to the field, which means that all incidents affect the ordering in real time. Requires bootstrap.</li>
	<li class="p1"><b>Deferred storage </b>- incidents are stored to a separate table and cron is responsible for adding the incidents to the field. Requires bootstrap.</li>
	<li class="p1"><b>File storage</b> - this is an experimental lightweight incident storage which stores incidents to a temporary file. Non-bootstrap.</li>
	<li class="p1">Memcached storage is going to be released soon.</li>
</ul><p class="p1">Lets choose the live storage for this profile.</p>
<p class="p1">We're done here so save the profile.</p>
<b>2. Radioactivity Field</b>
<p class="p1">Next navigate to <i>Content types</i> under <i>Structure</i> (admin/structure/types) and click on manage fields on the Article content type we wish to add Radioactivity to. Create a new Radioactivity field. Once you have clicked save you are taken to the Field settings tab (which is empty). Click on the Edit tab. On this page select the profile we just created (since there is only one profile it is automatically selected) and add a reasonable default value for the energy field; 1000 points should be sufficient if one incident emits 10 points of energy.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/addfield.png"><img alt="" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/addfield.png" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Next, go back to the <em>Content types</em> page and click on the <em>manage display </em>link. Here we can configure the way the field works.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/5.png"><img alt="" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/5.png" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We can choose the amount of energy of one view emits or disable it by setting it to 0. We also have an option to display the amount of energy the field holds as a raw value or percentage. Usually this is only needed on admin listing pages, so lets decide not to show anything (Note: at the moment due to field caching these are not updated live; cache clear or a cron run solves the problem).</p>
<p class="p1">The final piece missing is a view which is ordered by the field we just created.</p>
<b>3. Views</b>
<p class="p1">Go to the <i>Views</i> listing page under <i>Structure </i>(admin/structure/views) and click on <i>Add a new view</i>. We will be listing Content of type Article with no default sorting on a page so choose some title and path for it also. The settings here do not really matter as we are only interested in the sorting order. Click on <i>Continue and edit</i>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/6.png"><img alt="" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/6.png" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">At the bottom left click on the <i>add</i> button to add a new sort criteria. On the following form we have to locate our field and add the <i>field</i> <i>energy</i> as the sorting criteria. Be sure to set the sorting to descending - otherwise you have the most popular articles at the bottom. Click on save and we're done!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/82.png"><img alt="" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u13/82.png" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">After creating articles and viewing them - and of course running cron - the ordering on the listing page we just created should be that of the articles popularity in the wanted time frame defined in the decay profile.</p>
<p class="p1">--</p>
<p class="p1">That is the most basic use case for Radioactivity both for historical and technical reasons. </p>
<p class="p1">Questions, thoughts?</p>

    <p>Last weekends we held great drupal event -- DrupalCamp Donetsk 2011. This is one of the places of next year <a href="http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/index.html">UEFA EURO 2012</a> and it was really great place for our meetup.</p>
<p>About 170 attendees have arrived and were around during <a href="http://donetsk.drupal.ua/en/program/session-schedule">20 sessions</a>. It is very interesting that more and more new companies in Ukraine start developing using drupal and shows huge interest in local meetups. We had people from different cities of Ukraine and even several people from Russia and Belarus.</p>

<p>We have had beautiful bar party as well. Rock group in one of the bars were playing couple of drupal songs that made huge success!</p>
<p>You are welcome to read more about figures of the event  here <a href="http://donetsk.drupal.ua/en/news/finishing-drupalcamp-donetsk-feedback-and-photos">http://donetsk.drupal.ua/en/news/finishing-drupalcamp-donetsk-feedback-a...</a></p>
Codesprint
<p>As I was one of organizers of the codesprint, I would like to share our experience about it. We didn't have super rockstar developers at our codesprint but managed to do very nice job -- rewrite module <a href="http://drupal.org/project/draggableviews">draggableviews</a>. There are plenty of very good developers in Ukraine but it is a pity that not many people understand importance of the contributing. So we started from ground level of using issues queue and creating patches and finished with workable code. We had several teams (every team not more than 6 people) who were working on different topics: draggableviews, couple views issues, porting api.drupal.ru to drupal 7, setting up development environment (for beginners). In this way we were able to attract new people to contributions but keeping our concentration for the final result.</p>

    <p>When we are writing our own module we, as good developers, should allow other people extend/modify some parts of it. Yes we are talking about defining our own module's hooks. But what we can do if we need to "extend" our module in several places but we should be sured that other module that implements one hook should also implement another one? What we should do if we have a lot of such cases and we should take care about consistency of implementations of other modules? Also sometimes we would like user to decide what implementation to run (so we want some kind of administration page where we select what extention to be active).</p>
<p>One of the solutions for such situation is to define ctools plugins as the way to extend our module's functionality. In this article I would like to explain how to do this and how to take care about consistency.</p>
<p>First of all of course we need to have ctools as dependency. But truly to say it should not be a problem as nowadays it is nearly a must dependency for every project.</p>
<p><a href="http://ygerasimov.com/sites/default/files/example_ctools_form.png"><img src="http://ygerasimov.com/sites/default/files/example_ctools_form.png" /></a></p>
<p>For the practical example we will take very simple task -- we write a form that calculates different operations with two numbers. Every operation should be implemented as plugin as we need it to do several tasks:</p>
<p>1. Validate input<br />
2. Calculate operation<br />
3. Display nice message with result</p>
<p>So lets see how we can define our "operation" plugin and how we should use it in our code.</p>
<p>To define the plugin we should implement hook_ctools_plugin_type.</p>

&lt;?php
/**
 * Implements hook_ctools_plugin_type().
 *
 * Has plenty options. See ctools/help/plugins-creating.html
 */
function example_ctools_plugin_type() {
  return <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
    'operation' =&gt; <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
      'use hooks' =&gt; TRUE,
    ),
  );
}
?&gt;

<p>This hook has a lot of various options. In order not to rewrite help document I would recommend to look at it when you will decide to create your own plugins.</p>

<p>Now lets see the code that uses plugins (main module).</p>
&lt;?php
/**
 * Form constructor for Calculations demo.
 */
function example_calculation($form, $form_state) {
  // Load all plugins type "operation".
  ctools_include('plugins');
  $operations = ctools_get_plugins('example', 'operation');
  $operation_options = <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>();
 
  foreach ($operations as $id =&gt; $operation) {
    $operation_options[$id] = $operation['label'];
  }
 
  if (<a href="http://www.php.net/empty">empty</a>($operation_options)) {
    $form['message'] = <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
      '#markup' =&gt; <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('Sorry no operation plugins available in the system.'),
    );
    return $form;
  }
 
  $form['operations'] = <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
    '#type' =&gt; 'checkboxes',
    '#title' =&gt; <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('Please choose Operations'),
    '#options' =&gt; $operation_options,
  );
 
  // Form elements...
 
  return $form;
}
?&gt;

<p>Our form has checkboxes of operations that are available in the system, two textfields for numbers and submit button. Every operation plugin has 'label' property that is shown as label of the checkbox.</p>

<p>This is how we validate the form:</p>
&lt;?php
/**
 * Validate handler.
 */
function example_calculation_validate($form, &amp;$form_state) {
  $fv = $form_state['values'];
  $operations = <a href="http://www.php.net/array_filter">array_filter</a>($fv['operations']);
 
  foreach ($operations as $operation) {
    if ($instance = _example_get_instance($operation, $fv['number_a'], $fv['number_b'])) {
      $instance-&gt;validate();
    }
  }
}
?&gt;

<p>Here I would like to explain a bit more in details. Every plugin defines a class that perform main job for us: validate, calculate and show the message. Every class should inherit abstract class "example_operation" that allows us to ensure that plugin class is consistent.</p>

<p>Here how _example_get_instance() works:</p>
&lt;?php
function _example_get_instance($id, $number_a = NULL, $number_b = NULL) {
  $instances = &amp;drupal_static(__FUNCTION__);
 
  if (!<a href="http://www.php.net/isset">isset</a>($instances[$id])) {
    ctools_include('plugins');
    $plugin = ctools_get_plugins('example', 'operation', $id);
    $class = ctools_plugin_get_class($plugin, 'handler');
    $instances[$id] = new $class($number_a, $number_b);
 
    // Check that plugin class has ingerited proper 'example_operation' class.
    if (!<a href="http://www.php.net/is_subclass_of">is_subclass_of</a>($instances[$id], 'example_operation')) {
      $instances[$id] = NULL;
    }
  }
 
  return $instances[$id];
}
?&gt;

<p>So here we explicitly check whether plugin's class is inherited from our example_operation class and if not, we just don't return object.</p>

<p>Now lets take final look at our form processing -- submit handler:</p>

&lt;?php
function example_calculation_submit($form, &amp;$form_state) {
  $fv = $form_state['values'];
  $operations = <a href="http://www.php.net/array_filter">array_filter</a>($fv['operations']);
 
  foreach ($operations as $operation) {
    if ($instance = _example_get_instance($operation, $fv['number_a'], $fv['number_b'])) {
      <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/drupal_set_message/6">drupal_set_message</a>($instance-&gt;resultMessage());
    }
  }
}
?&gt;

This is very nice, but how we should implement plugins in our modules? There are two ways to do that. First is to implement hook_MODULE_PLUGIN. CTools automatically creates this hook for every plugin defined (there is an option to not accept hook implementation of plugins). In our case this is hook_example_operation.
&lt;?php
function multiple_divide_example_operation() {
  return <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
    'multiple' =&gt; <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
      'label' =&gt; <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('Multiple'),
      'handler' =&gt; <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
        'class' =&gt; 'example_multiple_operation',
      ),
    ),
    'divide' =&gt; <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
      'label' =&gt; <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('Divide'),
      'handler' =&gt; <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
        'class' =&gt; 'example_divide_operation',
      ),
    ),
  );
}
?&gt;

<p>Here we implement two operation plugins: provide label and handler class (we will come back on classes a bit later).</p>

<p>Another way to implement plugin is to define folder where ctools should look for files that are plugin implementations (hook_ctools_plugin_directory):</p>
&lt;?php
/**
 * Implements hook_ctools_plugin_directory().
 */
function sum_ctools_plugin_directory($module, $plugin) {
  if (($module == 'example') &amp;&amp; ($plugin == 'operation')) {
    return 'plugins/operation';
  }
}
?&gt;

<p>This means that module sum tells ctools to look at plugins/operation folder for plugins implementation. Here is file that will be found:</p>
&lt;?php
/**
 * Operation plugin for Example module.
 *
 * Calculate sum of two numbers.
 */
 
$plugin = <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
  'label' =&gt; <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('Sum'),
  'handler' =&gt; <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
    'class' =&gt; 'example_sum_operation',
  ),
);
 
class example_sum_operation extends example_operation {
  public function calculate() {
    return $this-&gt;a + $this-&gt;b;
  }
}
?&gt;
<a href="http://ygerasimov.com/sites/default/files/example_ctools_result.png"><img src="http://ygerasimov.com/sites/default/files/example_ctools_result.png" /></a>
<p>So in case of file implementation we should provide $plugin variable as array of properties. Of course best to do it in the beginning of the file.</p>

<p>These two ways to implement plugins are very convenient and used. For example panels uses file based plugins, but feeds module recommends implementation via hook. I would say that if you expect one module to provide a lot of plugin implementations it is better to have them as separate files as hook implementation array will really look too big. But it is up to you how to do this.</p>

<p>Now lets come back to classes. You already see that in case of sum operation class just implements method calculate().</p>

<p>This is how abstract class looks like:</p>
&lt;?php
abstract class example_operation {
  // Numbers we make calculations on.
  protected $a;
  protected $b;
 
  /**
   * Save arguments locally.
   */
  function __construct($a = 0, $b = 0) {
    $this-&gt;a = $a;
    $this-&gt;b = $b;
  }
 
  /**
   * Validate arguments. Return error message if validation failed.
   */
  public function validate() {}
 
  /**
   * Main operation. Calculate operation and return the result.
   */
  public function calculate() {}
 
  /**
   * Return result string for the operation.
   */
  public function resultMessage() {
    return <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('Result of !operation with arguments !argument_a and !argument_b is !result.', <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
      '!operation' =&gt; <a href="http://www.php.net/get_class">get_class</a>($this),
      '!argument_a' =&gt; $this-&gt;a,
      '!argument_b' =&gt; $this-&gt;b,
      '!result' =&gt; $this-&gt;calculate(),
    ));
  }
}
?&gt;

<p>So in order to provide operation that will work we really just need to inherit this abstract class and have calculate method in place (this is how "sum" operation is implemented).</p>

<p>For divide operation we have also implemented validate and resultMessage methods:</p>

&lt;?php
class example_divide_operation extends example_operation {
  public function validate() {
    if (<a href="http://www.php.net/empty">empty</a>($this-&gt;b)) {
      <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/form_set_error/6">form_set_error</a>('number_b', <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('Can\'t divide by zero!'));
    }
  }
 
  public function calculate() {
    return $this-&gt;a / $this-&gt;b;
  }
 
  public function resultMessage() {
    return <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('!argument_a divided by !argument_b is !result.', <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
      '!argument_a' =&gt; $this-&gt;a,
      '!argument_b' =&gt; $this-&gt;b,
      '!result' =&gt; $this-&gt;calculate(),
    ));
  }
}
?&gt;

<p>For multiplication operation we implemented only calculate method <strong>but</strong> haven't inherited class from our base abstract class to ensure it won't be working:</p>
&lt;?php
class example_multiple_operation {
  public function calculate() {
    return $this-&gt;a * $this-&gt;b;
  }
 
  public function resultMessage() {
    return <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/6">t</a>('Multiply !argument_a on !argument_b is !result.', <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(
      '!argument_a' =&gt; $this-&gt;a,
      '!argument_b' =&gt; $this-&gt;b,
      '!result' =&gt; $this-&gt;calculate(),
    ));
  }
}
?&gt;
<a href="http://ygerasimov.com/sites/default/files/example_ctools_validation.png"><img src="http://ygerasimov.com/sites/default/files/example_ctools_validation.png" /></a>

<p>One of the most important thing about defining your own plugins system is documentation. As it can be very hard for other developers to get themself familiar how plugin works and what it should implement in order to work. In this case defining plugins as classes that should inherit some abstract class is quite convenient as we can put our documentation in comments about methods of abstract class.</p>

<p>I am sure that this artificial example can be implemented easier but I hope it made clearer for you how to define your own ctools plugins and use them. A lot of modules use this system and surely you will need to write your plugins implementation for other modules.</p>

<p>Example module is attached.</p>

                    <p>About 6 months ago, I made a game for the Drupal community. I announced it in the local Colorado Drupal community and some other <a href="http://drupal.webstocks.ws/users/eaton">random</a> <a href="http://drupal.webstocks.ws/users/dries">people</a> have somehow found out about it, but it's still pretty small, and I should have extended an invitation to the wider community long ago. Better late then never.</p>

<p><a href="http://drupal.webstocks.ws/">Drupal Webstocks</a> is a virtual stock market game where anyone can invest fake money in Drupal projects, with prices based on the number of sites using each project. When projects get more users, the stock price goes up. When people stop using a project, the stock price goes down. The usage numbers come from Drupal.org, which updates weekly based on actual sites checking in for updates. So the challenge of Drupal Webstocks is to predict which projects people will be using in the future of Drupal. Unlike real stock markets, insider trading is encouraged, so if you think your own project is going to be the next big thing in Drupal, go ahead and buy it. If your project is already widely used, you may not be able to afford it until you earn more money. So far, no one has bought a share of <a href="http://drupal.webstocks.ws/project/drupal">Drupal core</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to projects as stocks, Drupal Webstocks just added another way to get rich with fake money: <a href="http://drupal.webstocks.ws/lottery/drupal-8-release-date">the Drupal 8 Release Date Lottery</a>. If you ask 10 people in the Drupal community when they think Drupal 8 will be released, you'll get 10 responses of "when it's done," followed by 12 different guesses as to when that might be. The idea of the Drupal 8 Release Date Lottery is to put some fake money on those guesses, with the correct entries winning all the money, just like a real lottery. Right now the prize is small, but as more people enter guesses the prize will go up. There's also a live graph of the most-guessed dates, so we can all see the collective wisdom of the Drupal community around when Drupal 8 will be released.</p>

<p>Drupal Webstocks gives you 250 cash to start, which is far from enough to buy shares of Drupal core or Views, but should be plenty to buy shares of newer projects or a Drupal 8 Release Date Lottery ticket. Happy investing!</p>

    <p>In this note I would like to share solution for quite common task: show node fields titles even if field are empty. By default if the field is empty it is not included in the node. But practically sometimes client would like to see title of the field even if the field value is not set. As this task has made me debugging for a while I hope it will save someone else's time.</p>
<p>So solution is to use hook_field_attach_view_alter(). This hook is invoked after field module added fields renderable arrays to the content of the node.</p>

&lt;?php

      $field = field_info_field($field_name);
      // Set output for field.
      $output[$field_name] = <a href="http://www.php.net/array">array</a>(

  <div class="feed-item-body">
    <p>Following up on my PIFT 6.x-2.7 Released post, I'd like to take a moment to walk you through another new feature which was introduced with the rollout of the new code.</p>
Advisory Coder Reviews
<p>Most are already familiar with the Coder module, which can be used to generate an automated report regarding common programming errors and Drupal coding style violations for a given module (or core).  So when we talk about 'advisory coder reviews', The 'coder review' part is pretty well understood ... but we're often asked what the 'advisory' piece means.</p>
<p>The answer to that is fairly straight-forward ... in terms of Drupal's automated testing infrastructure, an 'advisory' test is one which can return a pass/fail result which will not be included in the logic when calculating the overall pass/fail result for the patch or branch in question.  In other words, we don't want a 'Coder review' failure (and we expect many!) to result in the test bots failing an otherwise successful patch.</p>
<p>For now, we've enabled this feature on branch tests ... but if all goes well, it could be enabled on patch reviews in the future as well.</p>
<p>The first place you will see this feature in action is via the 'Automated Testing' tab on a given module's project page.  Instead of the usual "PASSED: [[SimpleTest]]: [MySQL] 33 pass(es)" test result message, we will now start seeing something a little more convoluted for tests from this point forward:</p>
<p>PASSED: [[SimpleTest]]: [MySQL] 33 pass(es); [[Coder]]: [Coder] 1 minor(s), 2 critical(s), and 42 normal(s).</p>
<p>To date, we've generally only had one testing plugin (SimpleTest) and one testing environment (MySQL) active ... but that changes with the introduction of this feature.  Incidently, the pattern used here is [[Testing Plugin]]: [Test Environment] Result;.</p>
Detailed Coder Results
<p>So where can you find the detailed Coder results?  These are made available through qa.drupal.org.  The first step is to click on your 'View Test' link:<br /><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/viewtestlink.png" width="480" height="193" alt="" title="" /></p>
<p>The Coder tab can be a little hard to find, but it's in the Details tab, underneath the 'Summary' bar:<br /><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/codertab.png" width="368" height="280" alt="" title="" /></p>
<p>Scroll down, and you should find your detailed Coder review results!<br /><img src="http://jthorson.doesdrupal.com/sites/jthorson.doesdrupal.com/files/coderresults.png" width="480" height="415" alt="" title="" /></p>
<p>Note that Coder is known to raise a few false positives, and we are running it on it's strictest settings ... so don't go beating yourself up trying to achieve a 100% pass result!  And if you <em>do</em> run into a Coder false positive, please consider submitting a patch!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>  </div>

<p>I recently attended DrupalCamp Austin and went to several sessions on mobile. It was a little funny how they contradicted each other. One session would talk about how mobile is the way to go then another session would talk about going responsive. I&#39;ve been on the fence on which I think is the right approach. I&#39;ve done lots of mobile sites, but I hadn&#39;t jumped into the responsive world yet. So for a recent project, I decided to give it a try.</p>

	First off, what do I mean?
<p>By mobile, I&#39;m talking about creating a site with a different HTML/CSS markup but serving the same content. When I do mobile, I generally use a tool to determine if the user is on a mobile device and then I serve the different content designed for the mobile device.</p>

<p>Drupal is an open source project with one of the largest group of contributors (nearly 10,000 developers in all). How does anything get done? How do the big decisions get made? What processes exist to make changes happen? How is the community structured? How do new people get a voice and navigate their way through?</p>
<p>In this Do it with Drupal session, Angie "webchick" Byron will discuss some facts and statistics about the Drupal community, as well as provide answers to these and other burning questions regarding how our “do-ocracy” functions, and why it matters to you.</p>

<p>If you're reading this message, <em>you use Open Source software.</em> The last fifteen years has seen the meteoric rise of tools like Linux, Apache, Firefox, WordPress, Drupal and more; simplyusing Open Source is old hat. When it comes to building your company's web strategy around open source tools, though, the decisions can be fuzzier. The best-known arguments for Open Source are often ideological rather than pragmatic, and fail to account for the different needs of different projects and businesses.</p>

The confusion seems common among the greater Drupal user-base, and it seems to affect more than just new Drupal users and those evaluating or considering using it, but also Drupal stakeholders who have several years’ of experience. <a href="http://buytaert.net/how-i-think-about-drupal-release-date-planning" alt="How I think about Drupal release date planning">According to Dries</a>, we should not expect to see Drupal 8 released for at least another 18 months. Yes, I’m aware that he was talking about 18 months <em>after</em> Drupal 7 hits its “productivity plateau”, and since he also indicated that he would announce when he thought we were at that plateau (and to my knowledge, he has not yet) it’s likely to be more than 18 months before we see Drupal 8’s release.</p>
<p> <strong>One user wrote:</strong> <br /><em>... I have several years working with Drupal 6 and I am thinking to start building sites and develop over Drupal 7, but <strong>it seems that Drupal 8 will be launched very fast.</strong> Is it best to wait some months and learn about Drupal 8?</em>And yet, for the past few months, we have been seeing increasing questions about Drupal 8 (in the greater developer and discussion community); questions which make the assumption that Drupal 8 is very close to release; a couple examples of such questions:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8206620/what-are-the-differences-between-drupal-7-and-8" alt="What are the differences between Drupal 7 and 8?" title="What are the differences between Drupal 7 and 8?">What are the differences between Drupal 7 and 8? (StackOverflow)</a></li>

           <p><img alt="" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u16/internet_explorer_9.png" title=" microsoft.com" />Debugging and testing sites in Internet Explorer (or Exploder as some might say) is certainly the moment of joy in every web developers life. You know the saying test early, test often so you can identify issues and bugs early. How many of us actually do testing with Internet Explorer in the early stages? Well maybe those that have Windows as their main development environment. But what about testing sites with IE when you are not using Windows but instead OS X or Linux? Do you actually have to pay for testing environment if you want to test IE compatibility? You can but you don't have to! In this blog post I will briefly go through the basis of the recommended ways to test sites in Internet Explorer 7, 8 and 9 and actually how to do it for free.</p>
Reliable ways to test sites in Internet Explorer
<p>So how can you actually get reliable results when testing sites in Internet Explorer? These IE collections seem to be pretty popular but those aren't the best option you have. The problem with IE colletions is that the pages might not render exactly same than they do if you are running just one version of IE on your Windows installation. So you can't actually be sure when the rendering is correct and when not. So what to use then? Let's find out!</p>
IEVMS (free)
<p>Microsoft provides virtual machine disk images (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=11575" target="_blank">link to download</a>) to facilitate website testing in multiple versions of IE, regardless of the host operating system. Setting up manually a dedicated virtual machine for each version of Internet Explorer using these image isn't actually that hard. It just takes a lot of your valuable time! To save some time for some important stuff (hey isn't this important!?!?) is to to use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> as virtual machine platform and <a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms" target="_blank">IEVMS</a> script to download, convert and install three different virtual machine instances each containing different IE version. The installer is going to download several gigabytes of stuff so best option is to leave it running for the night. You should note that there is also somekind of expiration time of three months so either take a snapshot after installing those images or you have to install them again after three months. You also need a lot of free disk space because you will actually have three separate Windows installations. So if you are low on disk space hop on to the next option (yeah, you can read the next one even if you have plenty of free disk space). </p>
BrowserStack (paid service)
<p><a href="http://www.browserstack.com/" target="_blank">BrowserStack</a> is a paid 3rd party service where you can test sites with different browsers. They have IE 6-9, Firefox 3-7, Chrome 12-15, Safari 4-5.1 and Opera 10 &amp; 11.5. They also have the <a href="http://www.browserstack.com/debugging-tools" target="_blank">debugging tools</a> preinstalled so you can just start debugging your javascript problems right away. You can even test the layouts that you have only on your hard drive or the local dev site you have set up on your dev environment. BrowserStack also offers you to test your site using different resolutions so you see if something doesn't fit to the browser window when using for example 1024x768 resolution. They offer 60 minutes of free testing time so you can test the service and see if you like it.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://mearra.com/sites/default/files/u16/browserstack-setup-tunnel.png" title="Setup tunneling in BrowserStack" /></p>
CrossBrowserTesting (paid service)
<p><a href="http://crossbrowsertesting.com/" target="_blank">CrossBrowserTesting</a> is also a paid 3rd party service where you can test different browsers. They have all the major browsers but the cool thing is that they also offer you to select your operating system. You can select for example OS X 10.5, Windows XP, Ubuntu 11.10, iOS or Android and you can select if you have for example flash or quicktime installed or not. You can see all the combinations that they have from <a href="http://crossbrowsertesting.com/configs" target="_blank">here</a>. They also offer you to test your local dev site as BrowserStack does. You can even take screenshots of the site, record video and trace the traffic between browser and the server. They offer free 7 day trial with 60min of testing time so you can actually try if you like the service or not. CrossBrowserTesting is a bit more expensive than BrowserStack but then again they do offer more variety in choosing the testing environment.</p>

General debugging tools
<p>If you are using those IEVMS images you might want to also install some tools which help you tracing the bugs that you might encounter. Even though you don't have the some sort of de facto testing tool <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">Firebug</a> available for IE you can use it's smaller sister <a href="http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite" target="_blank">Firebug Lite</a> to test your sites. It hasn't got all the magic that normal Firebug has but it still helps a lot in debugging stuff. Other great tool for debugging is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd565622(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank">Developer Tools</a> for Internet Explorer. It's built in feature but it's only available for IE8 and IE9. For IE7 you can use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=18359" target="_blank">IE Developer Toolbar</a> but it isn't near as good as Developer Tools is for IE8 and IE9. Then you also have <a href="http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/CompanionJS/HomePage" target="_blank">Debugbar CompanionJS</a> which is a similar debugging tool than Firebug Lite.</p>
<p>If you want to do some performance testing there is this wonderful tool <a href="http://ajax.dynatrace.com/ajax/en/" target="_blank">dynaTrace AJAX</a>. With dynaTrace AJAX you can actually trace which part of the page is lagging and for example find the slow javascripts that are jamming your site in IE.</p>
<p>So what is your favourite way to test your sites in Internet Explorer or do you just skip the testing until you-know-what hits the fan? :)</p>

    <p>My name is Maeghan, I am a Calgary born and raised girl on a mission since graduating from University called <a href="http://www.maeghansmulders.com/Maeghan/Project_ONE12.html">ProjectONE12</a>. I am interning in ten companies in one hundred &amp; twelve days across North America in search of my dream job.  I had the opportunity to work at <a href="http://us.fotolia.com/?gclid=CNLs-4PSzqwCFQrGKgodNELOrg">Fotolia</a> in Calgary, <a href="http://max.adobe.com/">Adobe MAX</a> in LA, <a href="http://www.bbdo.ca/en/home.html">BBDO</a> in Toronto, <a href="http://dealmakermedia.com/">Dealmaker Media</a> in San Francisco, <a href="http://www.tricofoundation.ca/">Trico Charitable Foundation</a> in Calgary and now at ImageX Media here in Vancouver! Since starting I have been featured in, <a href="http://www.women2.org/maeghan-smulders-1-girl-10-jobs-112-days-working-life/">Women 2.0</a>, <a href="http://watch.ctv.ca/news/top-picks/dream-job-hunt/#clip557445">CTV Live TV</a>, <a href="http://www.thestar.com/business/article/1073977--speed-interning-takes-young-grad-from-calgary-to-toronto-to-l-a-in-search-of-a-dream-job">Toronto Star</a>, <a href="http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/Have+work+will+travel/5585785/story.html">Calgary Herald</a>, and <a href="http://www.thereflector.ca/2011/11/10/doing-an-internship-try-10/">The Reflector</a>.</p>

	<p>My time at ImageX went by VERY quickly&#8230; I think that is because there was a lot of laughing, learning and foosball :)  The job for the week was to help with some research and marketing efforts for the company, but a major portion of time was on answering the question “why is ImageX a great place to work”.  </p>

	<p>So I got to shoot a video!!!  </p>

	<p></p>

	<p>ImageX Media has created some of the top websites in North America and specialize in Drupal development, which was something that I really enjoyed learning about.  However what I really loved was the atmosphere they created in the office.  Its a tech company, so its super casual and relaxed even in the way they interact as a team.  They each work on their own project, but collaborate and discuss aloud what they are working on with the rest of the team.  It was neat to hear them talk about things like&#8230; the vision they have for the site, how they want viewers to be able to interact and use the site&#8230; as well as what they wanted the overall experience to be like.  The whole team worked together and would bring in different knowledge and expertise to each project and it was so refreshing to hear the developers take such pride in the work they produced. Another cool thing is all the employees are heavily involved in the community through volunteering, educating and speaking at different events.  I love that! I think the idea of giving back is so important today, and it is refreshing to see that to the team of ImageX.. its not something they go out of their way to do, giving back is just a part of their every day life, which is something that I also try to do.</p>

	<p>I think the thing that I enjoyed most about the team was the opportunity to be surrounded by people who love what they do.  Everyone was so much fun to work with &#8211; so considerate and welcoming to share with me what they know, which was a big deal&#8230; because by no means am I a developer&#8230; sometimes I wish I could be.. I only know like two lines of code&#8230; but the team took the time to sit me down and tell me what they were working on, and asked for my help on non-technical aspects of their work.  </p>

	<p>The end of the week came fast&#8230; I think that is because i was laughing, learning and working hard the whole time I was there.  But my boss Glenn treats the office to lunch on Fridays and the team let me pick the type of food I wanted for my goodbye lunch.  We had a little pow-wow in the boardroom and I shared with them the adventures of this project so far as well as a blooper video I made for them. </p>

	<p>My time with ImageX was really special, I think I felt the closest with these coworkers because I interviewed them and learn about what they do, what they love, and shared a lot of laughs :)  I really felt like I made good friends there, and for that&#8230; I am super grateful. </p>
